Mother of God Plead with your Son
Pray for us sinners, Mary most pure

May God pour cleansing streams over us, 
Washing our souls from every stain.

May God his Spirit breathe into us, 
Open our graves and bring us to life.

May he remove our stony hearts. 
Give us a heart of flesh in its stead.

May we incline our minds to his voice, 
That we may bend our hearts to his will.

May he renew the strength of the weak. 
And be the hope of wavering wills.

That he may wipe away every tear, 
And make his Light to shine on our face.

   
G.11
Grant to us, O Lord, a heart renewed
Recreate in us, your own Spirit, Lord

G.G.11
Grant to us, O Lord our God
Grant a heart renewed
Recreate in us today the Spirit of your Son

Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord our God
When I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel

Deep within their being I will implant my law;
I will write it in their hearts

I will be their God, and they shall be my people

And for all their faults I will grant forgiveness;
Never more will I remember their sins
		
G.19
Forgive my sins, O Lord

In your kindness, have mercy on me God
In your tenderness, wipe away my faults

Wash me clean, cleaner yet from my guilt
And cleanse me from my sin O Lord

My offences, I know them, O Lord
and my sins I have constantly in mind

Against you, Lord, you alone have I sinned
What is evil in your sight I have done

Restore to me, O Lord, the joy of your salvation
Let the bones you have crushed rejoice again

God, may Saviour, deliver me from death
And my tongue will sing aloud your praises

Here my sacrifice; a broken spirit Lord
A humble contrite heart you will not spurn

G.21
Hear my cry, O Lord, my God
Listen to my prayer
From the earth’s end I call to you
When my heart is faint

Set me high on  a rock
You are my refuge, O Lord

Let me stay in your tent
Safe in the shade of your wings

I will echo your praise
Pay my vows day after day

G.22
Walk with me, O my Lord
Through the darkest night and brightest day
Be at my side, O Lord
Hold my hand and guide me on my way

Sometimes the road seems long, my energy is spent
Then, Lord I think of you and I am given strength

Stones often bar my path and there are times I fall
But you are always there to help me when I fall

Just as you calmed the wind and walked upon the sea
Conquer, my living Lord, the storms that threaten me

Help me to pierce the mists that cloud my heart and mind
So that I shall not fear the steepest mountain side

As once you healed the lame and gave sight to the blind
Help me when I’m downcast to hold my head up high 

G.	
Hear my cry O Lord attend unto my prayer
From the ends of the earth will I cry out to Thee.

And when my heart is overwhelmed, Oh Lord,
Lead me to the Rock that is higher than I,
That is higher than I.

For Thou hast been a shelter unto me,
A high tower, Lord, against the enemy.

And when my heart is overwhelmed, Oh Lord,
Lead me to the Rock that is higher than I,
That is higher than I.

That is higher than I,
That is higher than I. 

G.23
Great things happen when God mixes with us (2)
Great and beautiful, wonderful things;
great things happen when God mixes with us

Some find life, some find peace
Some people also find joy
Some see things as they never could before
And some people find that they can now begin to trust

Some find health, some find hope
Some people also find joy
Some see themselves as they never could before
And some people find that they can now begin to live

Some find peace, some are disturbed;
Some people also find joy
Some see their lives as they never could before
And some people find that they must now begin to change

G.27
I have roamed, I have groped in the night
I have stumbled on paths without light
Still I know I could walk without fear
You were there by my side always near
For this, I thank you, Lord
Yes, Lord, for the gift of your life

There were times in my life when I cried
When I cheated, offended and lied
Yet, O Lord, all my sins you forgave
Not to judge did you come but to save

If one day I forget O Lord
If the zeal for your house is no more
Then I’m sure you will come O my friend
To increase my weak faith once again

G.29
Fear not, for I am with you (2)
Be not dismayed be not dismayed for I am your God

I will strengthen you, I will help you (2)
Yes, I will uphold you
I will uphold you with my victorious right hand

I will direct you, I will guide you (2)
Yes, I will protect you….

I will comfort you, I will save you (2)
Yes, I will revive you….

I will gather you, I will feed you (2)
Yes, I will sustain you…

I will raise you up on the last day (2)
Yes, I will redeem you….

G.31
Yes, I shall arise and return to my Father
I will say: “I have sinned, I have sinned”

Father, against you alone have I sinned
How can I ever be called your child?
Treat me as one of your servants, O Lord
Accept me as a slave

Thank you, my Father, for giving me light
Courage and strength to return to you
Give me again, Lord, the joy your help
And make me walk aright

Praise to you, Father: you’ve shown me your love
Love that has raised me from death to life
Filling my heart with the Spirit of Christ
To be your child once more.

G.36
Though the mountains may fall and the hills turn to dust
Yet the love of the Lord will stand
As a shelter for all who will call on his name:
Sing the praise and the glory of God

Could the Lord ever leave you?
Could the Lord forget his love
Though a mother forsake her child
He will not abandon you

Should you turn and forsake Him
He will gently call your name
Should you wander away from Him
He will always call you back

Go to Him when you’re weary
He will give you eagle’s wings
You will run, never tire
For your God will be your strength

As He swore to your fathers
When the flood destroyed the land
He will never forsake you:
He will swear to you again
		
G.39
How much longer will you hide yourself from me?
How long must I face this struggle?
How much longer will this sorrow fill my heart?
How long must I fight this battle?

Look at me, O Lord, and answer
Give me back my strength, don’t let me die
Never let my foes begin to laugh at me
Never let my sins just weigh me down

I will lean on you, O Lord my God
I will sing for you because you’ll save me
I rely on love, your never changing love
You have been so good so I’ll rejoice 
	
G.41
Mercy, Lord, we have sinned, listen to our plea
Mercy, Lord, we have sinned, answer now our prayer

We have turned form the poor, let the hungry die
We neglect the oppressed, we ignore their cry
Now’s the time, now’s the day, turn back to your God
Tear your hearts, cry to Him; Spare your people Lord

We confess, we detest our disunity
We have lived for ourselves, failed in charity
Banish, Lord, from our hearts bitterness and pain
Cleanse, us Lord, heal our lives with your Spirit’s flame

G.52
You be my light O Lord

When the sun has set and the night is on
When the darkness falls and the light has gone
You be my light, O Lord, and lead on (2)

When I’m growing weak and my steps are slow
When the hopes are bleak and I’ve strength no more
You be my Strength, O Lord, and lead on (2)

When my eyes grow dim and I cannot see
When a chance is slim of a friend for me
You be my Friend, O Lord, and lead on (2)

When I cannot talk for there’s no one here
And I cannot walk though the end is near
 You be my light, O Lord, and lead on (2)

G.53
Coming Home
I’ve wandered far away from God
Now I’m coming home
The paths of sin too long I’ve trod
Lord I’m coming home
Coming home, coming home, never more to roam
Open wide Thine arms of love, Lord, I’m coming home

I’ve wasted many precious years, now….
I now repent with bitter tears, Lord..

I’m tired of sin and straying, Lord, Now…
I’ll trust Thy love, believe Thy word, Lord…

My soul is sick, my heart is sore, Now..
My strength renew, my hope restore, Lord…

G.54
Come back, my love
There are times, when I have wandered
There are days so steeped in sin
There are times when I have floundered
For there’s  darkness deep within
Now’s the time for my returning
Now’s the time for my returning
Far from you I’ve strayed away
For your love my heart is longing
And that time must be today
Come back, my love, you call me
Come back to me and stay
My heart is full of mercy
For the sinner who goes astray

All the past is now forgotten
And with you a new day dawns
Though your heart my sin has broken
Yet your love goes on and on
And I try to hide my feeling
Though I know where I belong
Of your love my heart keeps singing
In a never ending song

For the sins I had committed
All my tears have washed away
In your love I have confided
In your arms you let me stay
But the world keeps always judging
For my heart it does not see
Only you with eyes so searching
See the change of heart in me
