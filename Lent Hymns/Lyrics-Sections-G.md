Mother of God Plead with your Son
		Pray for us sinners, Mary most pure
	1.	May God pour cleansing streams over us, 
		Washing our souls from every stain.
	2.	May God his Spirit breathe into us, 
		Open our graves and bring us to life.
	3.	May he remove our stony hearts. 
		Give us a heart of flesh in its stead.
	4.	May we incline our minds to his voice, 
		That we may bend our hearts to his will.
	5.	May he renew the strength of the weak. 
		And be the hope of wavering wills.
	6.	That he may wipe away every tear, 
		And make his Light to shine on our face.
    E. Silent night, holy night,
All is calm, all is bright
Round you virgin mother and Child.
Holy Infant, so tender and mild,
Sleep in heavenly peace,
Sleep in heavenly peace.
	Silent night, holy night,
Shepherds quake at the sight;
Glories stream from heaven afar,
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia!
Christ the Savior is born,
Christ the Savior is born!
	
	Silent night, holy night,
Son of God, love’s pure light;
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace,
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth,
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth.
	
	Silent night, holy night
Wondrous star, lend thy light;
With the angels let us sing,
Alleluia to our King;
Christ the Savior is born,
Christ the Savior is born!

    E. Joy to the world, the Lord is come!
Let earth receive her King;
Let every heart prepare Him room,
And Heaven and nature sing,
And Heaven and nature sing,
And Heaven, and Heaven, and nature sing.
	Joy to the earth, the Savior reigns!
Let men their songs employ;
While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat, repeat, the sounding joy.
	No more let sins and sorrows grow,
Nor thorns infest the ground;
He comes to make His blessings flow
Far as the curse is found,
Far as the curse is found,
Far as, far as, the curse is found.
	He rules the world with truth and grace,
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness,
And wonders of His love,
And wonders of His love,
And wonders, wonders, of His love.
G.11	Grant to us, O Lord, a heart renewed
		Recreate in us, your own Spirit, Lord
G.G.11	Grant to us, O Lord our God
		Grant a heart renewed
		Recreate in us today the Spirit of your Son
	1.	Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord our God
		When I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel
	2.	Deep within their being I will implant my law;
		I will write it in their hearts
	3.	I will be their God, and they shall be my people
	4.	And for all their faults I will grant forgiveness;
		Never more will I remember their sins
		
G.19	Forgive my sins, O Lord
	1.	In your kindness, have mercy on me God
		In your tenderness, wipe away my faults
	2.	Wash me clean, cleaner yet from my guilt
		And cleanse me from my sin O Lord
	3.	My offences, I know them, O Lord
		and my sins I have constantly in mind
	4.	Against you, Lord, you alone have I sinned
		What is evil in your sight I have done
	5.	Restore to me, O Lord, the joy of your salvation
		Let the bones you have crushed rejoice again
	6.	God, may Saviour, deliver me from death
		And my tongue will sing aloud your praises
	7.	Here my sacrifice; a broken spirit Lord
		A humble contrite heart you will not spurn
G.21	Hear my cry, O Lord, my God
		Listen to my prayer
		From the earth’s end I call to you
		When my heart is faint
	1.	Set me high on  a rock
		You are my refuge, O Lord
	2.	Let me stay in your tent
		Safe in the shade of your wings
	3.	I will echo your praise
		Pay my vows day after day
G.22	Walk with me, O my Lord
		Through the darkest night and brightest day
		Be at my side, O Lord
		Hold my hand and guide me on my way
	1.	Sometimes the road seems long, my energy is spent
		Then, Lord I think of you and I am given strength
	2.	 Stones often bar my path and there are times I fall
		But you are always there to help me when I fall
	3.	Just as you calmed the wind and walked upon the sea
		Conquer, my living Lord, the storms that threaten me
	4.	Help me to pierce the mists that cloud my heart and mind
		So that I shall not fear the steepest mountain side
	5.	As once you healed the lame and gave sight to the blind
		Help me when I’m downcast to hold my head up high 
G.	Hear my cry O Lord attend unto my prayer
From the ends of the earth will I cry out to Thee.

And when my heart is overwhelmed, Oh Lord,
Lead me to the Rock that is higher than I,
That is higher than I.

For Thou hast been a shelter unto me,
A high tower, Lord, against the enemy.

And when my heart is overwhelmed, Oh Lord,
Lead me to the Rock that is higher than I,
That is higher than I.

That is higher than I,
That is higher than I.

		When I cheated, offended and lied
		Yet, O Lord, all my sins you forgave

		Yet the love of the Lord will stand
		As a shelter for all who will call on his name:

		He will gently call your name
		Should you wander away from Him
		He will always call you back

		He will give you eagle’s wings
		You will run, never tire
		For your God will be your strength

		When the flood destroyed the land
		He will never forsake you:
		He will swear to you again

		I will sing for you because you’ll save me
		I rely on love, your never changing love
		You have been so good so I’ll rejoice

		Tear your hearts, cry to Him; Spare your people Lord

		We have lived for ourselves, failed in charity
		Banish, Lord, from our hearts bitterness and pain
		Cleanse, us Lord, heal our lives with your Spirit’s flame

		Coming home, coming home, never more to roam
		Open wide Thine arms of love, Lord, I’m coming home

		My strength renew, my hope restore, Lord…
G.54	Come back, my love
	1.	There are times, when I have wandered
		There are days so steeped in sin
		There are times when I have floundered
		For there’s  darkness deep within
		Now’s the time for my returning
		Now’s the time for my returning
		Far from you I’ve strayed away
		For your love my heart is longing
		And that time must be today
		Come back, my love, you call me
		Come back to me and stay
		My heart is full of mercy
		For the sinner who goes astray
	2.	All the past is now forgotten
		And with you a new day dawns
		Though your heart my sin has broken
		Yet your love goes on and on
		And I try to hide my feeling
		Though I know where I belong
		Of your love my heart keeps singing
		In a never ending song
3.	For the sins I had committed
	All my tears have washed away
	In your love I have confided
	In your arms you let me stay
	But the world keeps always judging
	For my heart it does not see
	Only you with eyes so searching
	See the change of heart in me
