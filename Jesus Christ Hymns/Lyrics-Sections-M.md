M.13	Jesus meek and humble of heart
		Make my heart like yours

		And I will give you rest
		Take my yoke and learn from me
		I am meek and humble of heart
	2.	Come to me, you who are thirsting for water
		And I will give you drink
		Come and stay beneath my cross
		From my heart flow living streams

		When I’m the light of life?

		I’m the Way, the Truth and the Life

		Stilling the tempest and calming the sea
		Turning life’s water to glittering wine
		Shedding your blood for me

		Jesus, my way and my truth and my life
		Jesus who sets me free

		Jesus, the King of peace
M.23	Sing life, sing love sing Jesus
		Sing out whoever you are (2)
	1.	Life is around us to use or abuse
		Life in the great or the small
		Each one of us has the power to choose
		Whether to notice or just ignore life’s call
	2.	Love is around us to take and to give
		Love bringing life to us all
		Each one of us in the way that we live
		Shows that we notice or just ignore love’s call
	3.	Jesus loved life, but for love Jesus died
		Jesus the truth and the way
		Though life was lost and the truth was denied
		Love lives again as we greet the Lord’s new day

		Let Jesus enter your soul
