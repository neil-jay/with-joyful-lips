Y.1

When he saw how great was their number, 
Jesus went up to the mountain, 
There he sat.
His disciples came about him; 
This was the teaching he gave :

Ant.: Blest are they, blest are they! (Happy indeed!)

    1. Blessed are the poor in spirit, the kingdom of heaven is theirs.

    2. Blessed are the patient, for they shall possess the land.

    3. Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.

    4. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for justice, for they shall have their fill.

    5. Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.

    6. Blessed are the clean of heart, for they shall see God.

    7. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the sons of God.

    8. Blessed are those who suffer persecution for justice sake, the kingdom of heaven is theirs.

All.: Rejoice and exult, be gladsome and joyful: 
Your reward in heaven shall be rich, shall be great.
