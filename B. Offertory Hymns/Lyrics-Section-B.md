**O take our hearts as well and consecrate them too.**<br>

Before you, loving Father, le tour offering rise,<br>
The symbol of a pure and holy sacrifice.<br>

Forgive us the sins of all our life.<br>

To thee, O Lord, our joy we give,<br>

Thy anxious moments that we live;<br>
Lighten our burden as we go.<br>

For all the living take Thou this gift,<br>
For our brothers and sisters who join in prayer,<br>
The absent ones our hearts we lift,<br>
Keep them all in Thy loving care.<br>

We must expect a share in His sorrow,<br>
If we must rise with Him.<br>

That I should obey your will, O Lord?<br>

Of your faithfulness and salvation I shall speak,<br>
And not hide your love and your truth from the people.<br>

In bread we bring you, Lord, our bodies' labour.<br>

But stand united now, one in belief.<br>
Oh we have gladly heard your Word, your holy Word<br>
And now in answer, Lord, our gifts we bring.<br>
Our selfish hearts make true,<br>
Our failing faith renew.<br>
Our lives belong to you, our Lord and King.<br>

The bread we offer you is blessed and broken,<br>
And it becomes for us our spirit’s food.<br>
Over the cup we bring, your Word is spoken:<br>
Make it your gift to us, your healing blood.<br>
Take all that daily toil plants in our heart’s poor soil,<br>
Take all we start and spoil, each hopeful dream,<br>
The chances we have missed, the graces we resist,<br>
Lord, in this Eucharist, take and redeem.<br>

Spirit filled, yet hungry we await your food,<br>
Poor though we are we have brought ourselves to you:<br>
We are yours, we are yours.
