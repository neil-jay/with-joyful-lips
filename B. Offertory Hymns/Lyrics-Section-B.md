Behold the bread O Lord, we offer unto your<br>
O take our hearts as well and consecrate them too<br>

Before you, loving Father, le tour offering rise<br>
The symbol of a pure and holy sacrifice<br>

O let us be your harvest, Harvester Divine<br>
We offer you the sheaves, Lord, full of grain so fine<br>

O nurture all your grape vines, let their branches stretch<br>
That they may spread afar, Lord over all the earth<br>
<br>

Take thou the offering thy children make<br>
all united for thy name’s sake<br>

Heavenly Father, almighty God,<br>
We offer Thee this sacrifice<br>
Show to us thy mercy O Lord<br>
Forgive us the sins of all our life<br>

To thee O Lord our joy we give<br>
Our weariness, our work and woe<br>
Thy anxious moments that we live<br>
Lighten our burden as we go<br>

For all the living take Thou this gift<br>
For our brothers and sisters who join in prayer<br>
The absent ones our hearts we lift<br>
Keep them all in Thy loving care<br>
<br>

Our gifts of bread and wine, which once were<br> 
wheat and grape, will be your flesh and blood<br>

Fruit of the earth and work of our hands<br>
It will become the bread of life<br>

B.9<br>
United in one body with Jesus Christ the Lord<br>
we bring to You our offering of bread and wine O Lord<br>

We are the wheat of Christ<br>
If we be ground in the mill of life<br>
May we be found pure bread<br>

We are the grape of Christ<br>
If we be crushed in the wine-press of suffering<br>
May we be found pure wine<br>

We are the Body of Christ<br>
We must expect a share in His sorrow<br>
If we must rise with Him<br>
<br>

Only thy hand gives greatness and strengthens<br>

do we give thee;<br>
Thy name be blessed for ever and ever<br>

In bread we bring you, Lord, our bodies' labour.<br>
in wine we offer you our spirit’s grief.<br>
We do not ask you, Lord, who is my neighbour?<br>
But stand united now, one in belief.<br>
Oh we have gladly heard your Word, your holy Word<br>
And now in answer, Lord, our gifts we bring.<br>
Our selfish hearts make true,<br>
Our failing faith renew.<br>
Our lives belong to you, our Lord and King.<br>

The bread we offer you is blessed and broken,<br>
And it becomes for us our spirit’s food.<br>
Over the cup we bring, your Word is spoken:<br>
Make it your gift to us, your healing blood.<br>
Take all that daily toil plants in our heart’s poor soil,<br>
Take all we start and spoil, each hopeful dream,<br>
The chances we have missed, the graces we resist,<br>
Lord, in this Eucharist, take and redeem.<br>
