For us to Live, is to believe in Jesus the Christ and in the One 	who sent Him

Though we have never heard his voice nor seen his face
We hope to let his word take root in our lives

It is in spirit an din truth that we are known;
Free to be lifted up in each other’s lives

Simply to live for one another as bread;
This is the call of Jesus stirring within

It is God’s spirit that gives life and not the flesh;
Yes, Jesus’ words, for us, are spirit and life

Nothing can take from us the hope in which we’ve grown
Not even death shall separate us from his love

With inner freedom to be gift with our lives
No longer shall our days be centered on self

If we should thirst for truth and ask for more of life
Then shall the Spirit waken faith that is real			

A.81
What a Joy for us to say:
“We’re on our way to the house of the Lord” (2)

Coming to Jerusalem, on this holy ground
City mounted on a hill, its houses all around

Everyone is going there to where the temple stands

Through your gates we’ll enter in, open wide the door
Here we’ll find a welcome place and a peace for evermore

Here within your walls each one may be safe at last
City of my happy heart, a fortress holding fast

Dearest name of all my friends, may you prosper still
Standing like a sentinel on Zion’s royal hill

Listen, let your heart keep seeking
Listen to his constant speaking
Listen to the Spirit calling you
Listen to his inspiration
Listen to his invitation
Listen to the Spirit calling you

He’s in the sound of the thunder, in the whisper of the breeze 
He’s in the might of whirlwind, in the roaring of the seas

He’s in the laughter of children, in the patter of the rain
Hear him in cries of the suffering, in their moaning and their pain
 
He’s in the noise of the city, in the twitter of the bird
And in the night time the stillness helps you listen to his word

He speaks though all your companions, thru the friendly, thru the foe
Therefore give ear to the Spirit wheresoever He may blow

Teach me how to live my day
Guide me on the path of right

Come, Lord Jesus, come, Come to pray with me to-day;
