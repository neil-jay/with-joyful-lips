I.7<br>
The spotless Robe of Christ<br>
The spotless robe of Christ was mine<br>
The day I was baptised<br>
The spotless robe of Christ was mine<br>
The day I was baptised<br>
And at his feast I took the place<br>
Of those who his call had despised<br>
The spotless robe of Christ was mine<br>
The day I was baptised<br>

His loving  hand was placed on me<br>
And he did call me friend<br>
And claiming me as his own child<br>
Did royal favours extend<br>

The light of Christ now shines through me<br>
His Paschal joy on my brow<br>
With lamp alight the bridegroom shall find<br>
Me always awaiting Him now<br>

What joy to be in Paradise<br>
And share God’s heavenly bliss<br>
And we ourselves shall godlike be<br>
Our faces resplendent like his<br>
<br>
I.24<br>
Good news, good news.. Go proclaim to all the G.N., G.N.<br>
Go and tell the world “With Jesus we have<br>
Risen, alleluia, death shall reign no more”<br>

We have broken bread in his memory<br>
We have drunk his wine<br>
We have shared the meal of sincerity<br>
Now we walk in love<br>

We impart a secret which God decreed<br>
Ere the world began<br>
That grain of wheat should fall and die<br>
If it must bear fruit<br>

Listen to the folly of what we preach<br>
Take heed and believe<br>
All we know is nothing but Jesus<br>
And him crucified<br>
<br>
I.27<br>
Proclamation:<br>
He is Lord He is Lord<br>
He is risen from the dead and He is Lord<br>
Every knee shall bow, every tongue confess<br>
That Jesus Christ is Lord
