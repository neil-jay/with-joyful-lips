Brightening all the earth's dark night.<br>

From the depths of weary bondage,<br>
All mankind has risen too,<br>
All eyes are opened from their blindness<br>
To the Light of heav'nly view,<br>
And with Christ they rise anew.<br>

Fills with hope and with gratitude;<br>
They rise resplendent from their bondage,<br>
For their Lord has set them free,<br>
From the pow'r of death's decree.<br>

# I.7<span> THE SPOTLESS ROBE OF CHRIST<br>

The spotless robe of Christ was mine,<br>
The day I was baptised.<br>
The spotless robe of Christ was mine,<br>
The day I was baptised.<br>

And at his feast I took the place<br>
Of those who his call had despised,<br>
The spotless robe of Christ was mine,<br>
The day I was baptised.<br>

His loving  hand was placed on me<br>
And he did call me friend.<br>
And claiming me as his own child,<br>
Did royal favours extend.<br>

The light of Christ now shines through me,<br>
His Paschal joy on my brow.<br>
With lamp alight the bridegroom shall find<br>
Me always awaiting Him now.<br>

What joy to be in Paradise<br>
And share God’s heavenly bliss!<br>
And we ourselves shall godlike be,<br>
Our faces resplendent like his.<br>

Also will bring you to life.<br>

Children of God, your Lord will appear<br>
