# Q.3<span> THE LORD IS HERE<br>

His voice can be heard in the roaring<br>
Of breakers that crash on the shore.<br>
His splendour is seen in the morning<br>
As sunlight is coming once more.<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Arise and come, the Lord is here!**<br>
**Arise, my friends. He comes to share with you**<br>
**A life that never ends.**<br>

His love can be seen in the children<br>
Who romp in the playground in spring<br>
His beauty is found in the faces<br>
Of all who can smile and sing.<br>

His might can be seen in the mountains<br>
So still with the snow on their crest.<br>
His pity is seen in the swallow<br>
That cares for the young in its nest.<br>

He comes in the heat of the city<br>
'Mid noise of the cars and the mills.<br>
He comes in the peace of the forest,<br>
In desert or cool of the hills.<br>
<br>
# Q.4<span> IT'S UP TO ME<br>

There's my neighbour so lone and forgotten,<br>
It's up to me to make things lighter for him.<br>
There's my neighbour so lone and forgotten.<br>
It's up to me to help him through.<br>
If I can work with courage for the cause of rights,<br>
Then my neighbour, so lone and forgotten,<br>
May find the strength to live to-day.<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Love and friendship have a power,**<br>
**Love and friendship can bring new joy**<br>
**and hope to all.**<br>

There's my neighbour who can't get employment.<br>

There's my neighbour who's seeking a lodging.<br>

There's my neighbour who can't get a hearing.<br>

There's my neighbour so tried by injustice.<br>
<br>
# Q.10 <span> IN NEED OF LIBERATION<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**The world stands in need of liberation, my Lord,**<br>
**It still has to feel your power.**<br>
**The blind and the deaf, the dumb and the maimed,**<br>
**All need to feel your healing touch.**<br>
**The world stands in need of liberation, my Lord.**<br>
**It still has to learn to love.**<br>

There are those who have eyes but refuse to see<br> 
the inhumanity thatâ€™s done.<br>
There are those who have ears but refuse to hear<br>
the cries of those in agony.<br>

There are those who have mouths but refuse to speak<br>
against injustice done to some.<br>
There are those who have hands but refuse to reach<br>
them out in love and charity.<br>

There are those who have talents they do not<br>
use to build a true community.<br>
And we know that we all have the talent to love<br>
but leave it buried in ourselves.<br>
<br>
# Q.11<span> ASK AND YOU WILL RECEIVE<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Ask and you will receive,**<br>
**seek and you will find.**<br>
**Knock and the door will be opened**<br>
**For the love of the Lord has no end.**<br>

Is there any one here, when his son asks for bread,<br>
Would turn him away with a stone instead?<br>
Is there any one here when his child asks for meat,<br>
Would then give him a poisonous snake to eat?<br>

So then how could your Father in heaven above,<br>
Who knows so much more of the ways of love,<br>
So then how could your Father refuse what is good,<br>
When you ask in the name of the Son he loves?<br>

So whatever you ask you will always receive,<br>
Whatever you seek you will always find.<br>
For my Father will give to all those who believe<br>
In the Spirit of love that will never end.<br>
<br>
# Q.12<span> CAST YOUR CARE UPON THE LORD<br>

Why let worry get you down?<br>
The Lord is there to help you.<br>
Why put on a troubled frown?<br>
There's something better you can do.<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Cast your care upon the Lord and be sure He'll help you.**<br>
**Cast your care upon the Lord, for He's asked you to.**<br>
**Nothing ever is too great for Him.**<br>
**There's never nothing He can do.**<br>
**Cast your care upon Him, great and small,**<br>
**He'll see you through.**<br>

And if things seem inside out,<br>
oh! don't be too upset,<br>
There's always a sure way out,<br>
a way you never will regret.<br>

If hard times are on your trail<br>
and nothing turns out right,<br>
Ask the Lord, He'll never fail to help<br>
and make your burden light.<br>
<br>
# Q.14<span> LISTEN, LISTEN<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Listen, listen, listen every one:**<br>
**God is here for you and He is here for me.**<br>
**Listen, listen, listen, can't you hear?**<br>
**His love is here to stay,**<br>
**His word is ever new.**<br>

Listen to the well-spring of deepest love and joy<br>
That comes from here within my soul,<br>
Listen, can't you hear?<br>
Listen, listen, listen every one,<br>
God is here for you and He is here for me.<br>

Peace, be still, be silent and<br>
You'll hear the whispered roar,<br>
And if you cannot hear,<br>
I will tell you once more: Listen...<br>

Listen, O my people,<br>
all you children of the world<br>
Listen to our God as He whispers in your ear...<br>
<br>
# Q.20 <span> PUT A LITTLE MORE OF JESUS<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Put a little more of Jesus in your life,**<br>
**The world will be a happy place:**<br>
**No more fighting, no more strife,**<br>
**Every one would have a smiling face!**<br>

No worry, no care, no crying over what to wear,<br>
For all would learn to trust the power of Providence.<br>

No hunger, no thirst, no clamouring to be the first,<br>
For each would seek to benefit his neighbour.<br>

No sorrow, no fear, no one would have to shed a tear,<br>
For everywhere the Lord would live to strengthen.<br>

No fences, no walls, no preferential dining halls,<br>
No prejudice, no favourites, no snobbery.<br>

No bloodshed, no wars, no breaking up of friendship bonds,<br>
No enemies, no refugees, no tyrants.
