DD.1	
This is my commandment
Love one another as I have loved you (2)

Charity is kind, feels no envy
Charity bears up to the end
Charity is meek, seeking not its own
Charity has faith to the end

Charity is mild, thinks no evil
Charity can hope to the end
Charity is just, finding joy in truth
Charity is patient to the end

Charity is never conceited
Charity brings joy to the end
Charity is never resentful
Charity makes peace to the end

I may speak in tongues, be a prophet
Understand every mystery
Even though my faith may move mountains
With no love, I’m nothing at all

I may give away my possessions
Even give my body to be burnt
If I have no love, I’m no better
For of all the greatest is love

D.3
Prayer for Unity
Ref. 1:	Gracious Lord, deign to gather in your Kingdom
All the peoples who fill the universe

Ref.2:	Save us Lord, gather us from all the nations
To give glory unto your holy name

As grains of wheat in the host
Form the Bread of Life
And as the grapes are pressed
To make the precious Wine
Help us to keep this unity
In the bond of peace and charity

O God of Love, shed your light
Over all the earth
Give us the strength to spread
Fraternal love and zeal
To kindle all humanity 
With the mighty flame of charity

Companions all, from the towns
From the countryside
From every plain and field
From vale and mountain height
Come ‘neath the shadow of the cross
One in faith and trust, in Jesus Christ

D.6
I’ve received the living Bread
Ant.1:
I’ve received the living Bread and my heart is filled with joy (2)

Ant.2:	Every one who lives in me shall obtain eternal life (2)

He says to me: I am the Bread
Which I give to feed your soul
He who eats of this my flesh
Will attain the heav’nly goal

He says to me: I am the Vine
Which will nourish every shoot
As it feeds upon my sap
It will give abundant fruit

He says to me: I am the Life
Which destroys eternal doom
Whosoever lives in me
Will rise like me from the tomb

He says to me: I am the Way
Where my Father waits for you;
If you follow in my steps
You will see me with him too

He says to me: I am the Light
In the darkness of your night
Whosoever welcomes me
Will be led on paths aright

D.13
With you as my guide, I’ll not want:
You are my Shepherd, Lord, nothing shall I fear

In pastures fresh and green
You give my soul response
Near cool and restful waters
My spirit you revive

In vales of gloom and death
No evil shall I dread
Your strength and peaceful presence
Will be my comfort sure

A banquet you have spread
While foes in envy watch
My head you have anointed
My cup now overflows

Your loving favour, Lord
Shall surely follow me
Until one day in heaven
For ever shall I dwell

D.18
Sing my soul at the joy that I feel
There is now, dwelling in me, my God

It is through you, Lord, that I act,
Ev’ry prayer, ev’ry thought of mine
Comes from you, Lord divine

Lord, it is your wish, that I may
By my life, show people around
How to love, more and more

It is to you, Lord, that I turn
When in need and my heart is grieved
For your love brings me joy

Lord, it is your wish that my life
In this world brings abundant fruit
For the kingdom of heaven

D.19
Jesus Christ, living in us
You are our gladness for ever

You are the Truth, the Light, alleluia
Now, as it was, for all the ages to come, alleluia

You are the Life, O Christ, alleluia
One who abides in you, for ever shall live, alleluia

You are the Word of God, alleluia
Who has revealed the Father’s love to the world alleluia

You are the Saviour, Lord alleluia
Into this world you came to save what was lost, alleluia

Then at the end of time, alleluia
You will return, for ever bringing us joy, alleluia

Praise be to you, O Christ, alleluia
Praise to the Father, Son and Spirit divine, alleluia

D.23
This is my will, my one command
That love should dwell among you all
This is my will that you should love
As I have shown that I love you

No greater love a man can have
Than that he die to save his friends
You are my friends if you obey
What I command that you should do

I call you now no longer slaves
No slave knows all his master does
I call you friends for all I hear
My Father say, you hear from me

You chose not me, but I chose you
That you should go and bear much fruit
I chose you out that you in me
Should bear much fruit that will abide

All that you ask my Father dear
For my name’s sake you shall receive
This is my will, my one command
That love should dwell in each, in all

D.27
Whatsoever you do to the least of my people, that you do unto me

When I was hungry, you gave me to eat		
When I was thirsty, you gave me to drink
Now enter into the home of my Father

When I was weary, you helped me find rest
When I was anxious, you calmed all my fears

When I was homeless, you opened your door
When I was naked, you gave me your coat

When I as little, you taught me to read
When I was lonely, you gave me your love

When in a prison, you came to my cell
When on a sick bed, you cared for my needs

In a strange country, you made me at home
Seeking employment, you found me a job

When I was laughed at, you stood by my side
When I was happy, you shared in my joy

D.29
Jesus always loved His own

Jesus always loved his own
and he showed it to the full
When at supper from the table
He got up and took a towel
Then he wrapped it round His waist
in a basin water poured
Then began to wash the feet of all his friends
Know, my people, what I’ve done to you
Lord you call me, It is what I am
If then I, your Lord, deigned to wash your feet
You should do the same and wash each other’s feet.

When He came to Simon Peter
the apostle said to him
“Never shall you wash my feet”
Then the Lord replied to him
“It is not for you to know what now I do”

….When He said to Simon Peter
“If I do not wash your feet,
You can have no part with me”
Then said Peter to his Lord:
“Wash my hands, my head and not my feet alone”

…. He has set us an example that we do as He has done
Can a servant greater be than his master Christ, the Lord?
If we know and do this, happy we shall be

DD.36
Christ’s love for us

Love is his word, love is his way
Feasting with all, fasting alone
Living and dying, rising again
Love, only love his way
Richer than gold is the love of my Lord;
Better than splendour and wealth (2)

Love is his way, love is his mark
Sharing his last Passover feast
Christ at his table, host to the twelve
Love, only love is his mark

Love is his mark, love is his sign
Bread of our strength, wine for our joy
“This is my body, This is my blood”
Love, only love, is his sign

Love is his name, love is his law
Hear his command, all who are his
“Love one another, as I have loved you”
Love, only love is his law

D.37
Take, eat, this is my Body
Take, drink of this cup
Poured for your and for many
Do this in remembrance of me

I am the living bread, come down from heaven
Anyone who eats this bread, will live for ever

He who eats of this, my flesh, and drinks my saving blood
Shall abide in me, and I abide in him

For my flesh is food indeed, my blood is really drink
Those who eat and drink, will have eternal life
			
D43.
The Lord is my Shepherd

The Lord is my shepherd
There is nothing I shall want
Fresh and green are the pastures
Where he gives me repose
Near restful waters he leads me
To revive my drooping spirit

Ref:
The Lord is my shepherd
There is nothing I shall want
Yes, the Lord is my shepherd
There is nothing I shall want

He guides me along
What he knows to be right
If I walk in the darkness
No evil would I fear
I know that he will be there
With his crook and with his staff

The Lord has prepared
Such banquet for me
Surely goodness and kindness
No evil would I fear
Shall follow after me
In the Lord’s own house shall I dwell
All the days of my life

D.44
No one can give to me 
That peace which my risen Lord
My risen King can give (2)

When I look around and see
All the things that trouble me
And I seem to lose my peace
In a world that’s not at ease

Says my risen Christ to me
My true peace I give to thee
But not as the world doth give
Is my peace that makes one live

His true peace in me will stay
As I live from day to day
And his joy will never end
And in heaven it will extend

Christ has risen from the dead
Triumphed over sin and death
And he’ll never die again
But as Lord he’ll live and reign

D.46
Take this all of you eat of this my flesh
Take this is my blood shed for sinners all
For my life I give and my love I share:
Trust and believe in me

Truly I say, my brethren
Should you not drink my blood
Should you not eat my body
You have no life in you

Work for the food that’s lasting
Work not for food that spoils
Work for the bread from heaven
And gain eternal life

I am the resurrection
I am the bread of life
One who has faith enduring
Will live for ever

D.49
O Lord, I’m not worthy
Yet you come to live in me
So speak your word of comfort
By your touch strengthen and heal me

Take this and eat my body
And drink my saving blood
Poured out for your redemption
A symbol of my love

Called to be God’s new people
Made one in Christ the Lord
Let us with hearts united
Bear witness of your love

Onward through life we journey
As seekers of the truth
Building each day a new world
Of justice, peace and love

D.51
Make me a channel of your peace

Make me a channel of your peace
Where there is hatred, let me bring your love
Where there is injury, your pardon Lord
And where there’s doubt, true faith in you
Oh Master, grant that I may never seek
So much to be consoled as to console
To be understood as to understand
To be loved as to love with all my soul

Make me a channel of your peace
Where there’s despair in life, let bring hope
Where there is darkness, only light
And where there’s sadness, ever joy

Make me a channel of your peace
It is in pardoning that we are pardoned
In giving to each one that we receive
And in dying that we’re born to eternal life

D.52
Come, Jesus, come into this heart of stone
Come, Jesus, come into this heart of stone
Melt and mould it and make it your own
Come, Jesus, come into this heart of stone
	
I’m not ashamed to tell you Lord
That I’m a sinner man
I just love to do the things
That go against your plan

Love your neighbour as yourself
Is what you command
But his sufferings, tears and pain
Is something I can’t stand

When my neighbour’s hungry
And naked in the street
I just cannot bear to see
And from him I retreat

You want me to be the salt
And leaven in the dough
But I prefer to stand aloof
And let the world just go

I want to change myself
I don’t wanna be a stone
I need your Spirit Lord
Cause I cant do it alone	

D.58
Let all that is within me, cry holy (2)
Holy, holy, holy is the Lamb that was slain

…. Mighty

…….worthy

…..blessed	

.…..Jesus

D.65
Lord, you are my everything
Lord, you are my friend
In this Bread you promise me
Life that has no end

Come, my strength, my Bread of life
Hold me your sway
Fill me with your presence, Lord
Guide me on my way

Come, my Way, my Truth, my Life
Show me how to live
Clear the storms that cloud my path
Teach me to forgive

Come, my Joy, my Love, my Heart
Come to me and stay
Speak your tender words of peace
To my heart to-day

D.66
We have received the Bread of Life
Joy fills our hearts again
We have received the Risen Christ
Jesus in us will reign

I am the Bread, he said
That will feed your soul
Eat of this, my flesh
Reach the heav’nly goal

I am the Vine… Nourishing each shoot
Live upon my sap, Give abundant fruit

I am the life… Life all people prize
If you live in me, With me you will rise

I am the Way… By which you all should go
Following in my steps, My Father you will know

I am the Peace…. No other peace endures
I am the only love, Which my peace ensures

I am the Lamb… Sacrificed for your
Take up your cross and be my disciple true

D.89
To be the body of the Lord in this world
To have his Spirit coursing through my soul
To know the passion of my Jesus in his love for every one
To show his mercy in the shadows of this land

Come, walk with me come share my life
You must know the shadows
If you would know the light

No eyes have I, no ears to hear
You must be my body
And show my Father’s care

I am the vine, branches are you
Life from me eternal
To make your world anew

One bread, one cup; one heart and mind
One great human people
In fellowship divine

D.90	
Bread that was sown in our hills and valleys
Now harvested, becomes one
From all the world gather your people O Lord
Into the feast of your love

With grateful hearts, we sing our joy
For knowing the Spirit within, among us all
Life and knowledge, revealed through your word
Jesus, the Christ, Emmanuel

Leaven and Wheat; so let us be for others
Nurturing good with earnest care
Bringing to birth new life where hope has gone stale
Faith-giving moments to share
		
D.93
Bind us together Lord, Lord bind us together
With cords that cannot be broken
Bind us together Lord, Lord (2)
Bind us together with love

There is only one God, there is only one King
There is only one Body, that is why I sing

Though there are many branches
There is only one Vine
We are one in Christ Jesus, that is why…

One with Christ in his death
That, as one, we might rise
So we are but one people, that is why…..

There is only one table
Christ alone is our host
He invites us together, that is why….

D.94
Yours is the Kingdom, Yours is the Power
Yours is the glory evermore
Lord, forever, Lord for evermore

From the ends of all earth
And out beyond the stars
Gathered in your presence we are one

One in the bread we break
And one in our concern
One with you we celebrate this day

Freedom is your gift for all
Who live and die in you
Freedom is finding life in you

Broken bread is scattered on
The hillsides and the plains
Broken hearts and bodies cry for rest

D.96
God is good to me

God is good to me O what love I see
Jesus as a lamb was slain
He delivered me, cleansed and set me free
Lord of all, He rose again
Now I live, yet not I
Jesus is alive in me
Sending the Spirit’s flame into my heart again
God has poured his love on me

God has shown his love, sent his only Son
Jesus Christ to save the world
Life eternal through his death He brought
Yes, believe that God is Love

God is perfect Love, one who lives in love
Lives in God and God in him
Yes, I feel his love; fear gives way to peace
Cause I know He loved me first

D.99
Make me an instrument

Make me an instrument of your peace;
Where there is hatred, let me bring love
Where there is injury, your pardon Lord
and where there’s doubt, true faith in you

Where there’s discouragement, let me bring hope
Where there is darkness, let me bring your light
and where there’s sadness let me bring joy

It is in pardoning that we are pardoned
It is in giving that we do receive
and it’s in dying that we’re born to life

D.100
Come to my Father through me (2)
I’m the way, the truth and the life
Come to my Father through me

Do not let your hearts be troubled
Over things you shouldn’t bother
Just trust in my Father and in me
And all things will follow

Lord, we do not have an idea
Where you are going
So how can we follow the way?
Teach us, we pray you

Words that I have spoken
I do not speak on my own
But the Father who dwells in me
Does his works through me

I am the way, the truth
I am the Life
No one can come to the Father
But only through me

D.104
Make me a servant, humble and meek
Lord, let me lift up those who are weak
And may the prayer of heart always be
Make me a servant, make me a servant
Make me a servant to-day

Even though you were in the form of God
You took the form of a slave
You accepted death even on a cross
So God exalted your name

Ere you formed me in my mother’s womb
You called me by my name
And you touched my mouth and appointed me
A prophet to the world

May I heal the sick and the crippled bind
Bring back the sheep that stray
May I seek the lost and the weak make strong
With justice feed the poor

D.105
My heart’s like a flute and I want to play all day
Jesus Christ is my music master
Deep from my heart flows a simple melody, 
Great is his love, love without end (2)

Once I met the Lord on the way;
Deep was his gaze, kind was his smile
True were his words, gentle his touch
He brought me peace and freedom

He’s my shepherded He’s my guide
Dark be the night, Christ is my light
Nothing I fear, Jesus is near
He leads me to the Kingdom

T’wards the land of promise we walk
There to find peace, there to find joy
There to find love, God has prepared
A banquet for his people

D.106
To become the bread of rejoicing
To become the wine of your love
To become the song of your gladness
To become your body, O Lord, Jesus Christ

See, O Lord, the bread of our pain
The bread we knead with our hands worn by sorrow
The bread of our grief, the bread of our suffering
Give us on this day, O Lord
Give us our daily bread

See, O Lord, the bread of our toil
The bread we sow which is ripe now for harvest
The bread of our work, the bread of our labour 
Give….

See, O Lord, the bread of our love
The bread we bread and we share with each other
The hearts that we give bring joy to the lonely….

See, O Lord, the bread of our life
The bread of heaven which brightens our pathway
The bread of the way that leads to the kingdom…

See, O Lord, the wine of our joy
The wine which flows from the grapes of our vineyards
The joy of the earth, the wine of our feasting….

D.111
When the kindness of our God

When the kindness of our God was revealed in Jesus
With compassion and with love were we born
In the spirit of that love, life abounds with thankfulness
For the gift we know in Jesus the Christ
May the grace of God be ever in our life
With a song may gratitude become our home
Alleluia, alleluia,  alleluia, alleluia

With the gentleness of peace, born in love of God as friend
So much healing and forgiveness shall we know
And with peace is sure to come such a deep abiding joy
Which the many deaths of life cannot dispel

In diverse and sundry ways of the past did God reveal
Something of the love in which life can thrive
But in Jesus did this love come to fullness for all time
And in Him we are alive with Spirit joy
		
D.113
I have loved you with an everlasting love
I have called you and you are mine (2)

Seek the face of the Lord and long for Him
He will bring you his light and his peace

…. His joy and His hope

….. His care and His love

D.118
Whatsoever you do

You see me hungry, lying on the footpath
I need your love and care to quench my thirst
I’m looking for some decent clothes and shelter
O see the state I’m in, the very worst
You’ll find me in the hospital so weary
Imprisoned by my loneliness so great
The victim of man’s cruel exploitation
How can you ever leave me to my fate?
Whatsoever you do to set your brother free
Whatsoever you do to end his misery
Whatsoever you do to bring him liberty
Whatsoever you do, you do it unto Me

Perhaps you’ll help to find me some employment
Or say a word to calm my anxious fears
Be brave to fight with me against injustice
Or sit by me an lend a listening ear
At times I need a word of consolation
The joy of seeing you standing by my side
I promise that your love will be rewarded
O come, you blessed and in heav’n abide

D.120
Take and eat

Gather at the altar, share the holy bread
Join in celebration of the words He said:
Take and eat; this is my body
Take and drink for this is my blood

We are all invited to the sacred meal
Food and drink he offers all our sins to heal

By the bread I give you, life will be restored
You will be my people, I will be your Lord

By the cup I offer, know that you are mine
Know that I am with you to the end of time

We must now pass over from the land of sin
Let the Holy Spirit write his law within

When you share this supper
When you drink this wine
You proclaim my dying till the end of time

D.121
Let there be Love

Let there be love shared among us
Let there be love in our eyes
May now Your love sweep this nation
Cause us, O Lord to arise
Give us a fresh understanding
Of brotherly (sisterly) love that is real
Let there be love shared among us, let there be love

….. Peace….
….  Joy ….

D.127
Seek you first

Seek you first the kingdom of God and his righteousness
And all these things shall be added unto you

Halleluiah (7)

Man shall not live  by bread alone
But by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God

Ask and it shall be given unto you
Seek and you shall find knock and it shall be opened to you

If the Son shall set you free
You shall be free indeed, you’ll know the truth
And the truth shall set you free

Let your light so shine before all
That they may see your good works
And glorify your Father in heaven

D.130
My peace I give unto you
It’s a peace that the world cannot give
It’s a peace that the world cannot understand
Peace to know, peace to live
My peace I give unto you

D.132	
As the deer pants for the water
So my soul longs after you
You alone are my heart’s desire
And I long to worship You
You alone are my strength, my shield
To You alone may my Spirit yield
You alone are my heart’s desire
And I long to worship you

I want You more than gold and silver
Only You can satisfy
You alone are the real joy-giver
And the apple of my eye

You’re my friend and You are my brother
Even though You are my Lord
I love You more than any other
So much more than anything	

D.136
Take this bread: It is my body
Take this cup: it is my blood
I will give you life eternal
One day I will raise you up

You are the bread come down from  heaven
Bread of God which give us life
He who eats and who believes
Will never hunger, never thirst

Whoever comes to You believing
Never will be turned away
You have come to do the will
Of Him who sent You with life for all

Well may we hear the words You give us
Words of God and Word of life
Build our faith and teach us how
To follow you and be one with God
