L.26<br>
My God, only source of my joy<br>
For you are my God, only source of my joy<br>
You keep me, O God, for cling unto you<br>
And defend me from all harm<br>

The faithful who dwell in the land<br>
Give me happiness<br>
And those who accept alien gods<br>
I’ll never speak of them<br>

Yes, Lord, you’re my portion and cup<br>
You I claim for my prize<br>
It’s you who keep filling my cup<br>
Assure my inheritance<br>

So I praise the Lord for his works<br>
He instructs my soul<br>
The Lord is my stronghold and might<br>
I shall stand firm with him<br>

L.28<br>
Then sings my soul<br>
Oh, Lord my God, when I, in awesome wonder<br>
Consider all the world thy hand has made<br>
I see the stars, I hear the mighty thunder<br>
Thy power throughout the universe displayed<br>
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to  Thee<br>
How great Thou art, how great Thou art (2)<br>

And when I think that God, his Son not sparing<br>
Sent Him to earth, I scarcely can believe<br>
That on the cross, our burden gladly bearing<br>
He gave his life for all the world’s relief<br>

And when draws near the day of my salvation<br>
What happiness, what joy shall fill my heart<br>
When I shall bow in humble adoration<br>
And then proclaim, my God, how great thou art<br>
<br>
L.29<br>
Spirit of joy, exceeding all joys,<br>
Fill every heart<br>
Through all creation spread your delight<br>
Joy of the Lord on earth<br>

Galaxies as you race through space<br>
Speed along to the song of creation<br>
Gentle star as you join in the chase<br>
Add your notes of jubilation<br>
Joy, joy, unspeakable joy, joy, God’s own bliss<br>
Joy of creation, God’s own joy on earth!<br>

Young folk with your vision rejoice<br>
Older folk, dream dreams of joy<br>
Tender babes, bring joy to your homes<br>
As the earth is filled with children<br>
Joy, joy unspeakable joy, joy, poured on us!<br>
Joy of creation, God’s own joy earth<br>

Pure of heart, rejoice with your Maker<br>
Let your works like his be pure<br>
May your joy be found in creating<br>
As you work from hour to hour<br>
Joy, Joy, unspeakable joy, joy, of the Just<br>
Joy of creation, God’s own joy on earth<br>
<br>
L.31<br>
The heavens declare the glory of God<br>
The glory of God, alleluia!<br>
The heavens proclaim his handwork<br>
And day and night sing his praise<br>

There is no speech nor are there words<br>
Their voice is not heard<br>
Yet they tell his glorious deeds<br>
Through all the earth<br>

God’s glory thunders loud over all<br>
He sits enthroned<br>
Over all the floods and seas<br>
As king evermore<br>

Give the Lord, sons of God<br>
The glory that’s due<br>
To the most High, wonderful name<br>
And he’ll give us peace<br>

L.37<br>
God still loves the world<br>

Every tiny star that twinkles in the night sky<br>
Every drop of morning dew<br>
Every spark of fire blazing in the furnace<br>
Every captivating view<br>
Every rainbow in the sky, every pretty butterfly<br>
Tells the fascinating news to those who dare to hope<br>
And the message is :<br>
God still loves the world!<br>
God still, still loves the world<br>
So throw your life into his hands<br>
Day by day discern his plans<br>
God is passionately busy loving you and me<br>

Every ocean wave that breaks upon the sea shore<br>
Every stalk of golden wheat<br>
Every silver stream that gushes down the mountain<br>
Every drop of honey sweet<br>
Every eagle flying high every worm that wriggles by…<br>
Tells the fascinating news to those who dare to hope<br>
And the message is :<br>
God stil…<br>

Every man and woman pledged in love forever<br>
Every little new born child<br>
Every voice in favour of a needy neighbour<br>
Every radiating smile<br>
Every hand that offers love, every surging flow of blood…<br>
