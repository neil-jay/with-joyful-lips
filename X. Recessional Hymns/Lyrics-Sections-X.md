The nations tremble and kingdoms shake,<br>
For God speaks and all the earth dissolves.<br>
The Lord Almighty is here with us.<br>
The God of Jacob helps us in distress. So...<br>

So come and see his amazing works,<br>
He causes wars to end throughout the world,<br>
And every weapon He does destroy.<br>
"Be still", He says "and know that I am God". So...<br>

Proving we are weak and need God's strength.<br>
Carrying in our flesh the death of Jesus,<br>
We must show his life at work in us.<br>

Daily is the inner man renewed,<br>
For the love of Jesus Christ controls us,<br>
Since we know that one man died for all.<br>

We are Christ's letter written on the human heart,<br>
Inscribed by the Spirit of the Lord.<br>
