#X.3 <span> TO THE WORLD WE GO<br> 
Lightened by the word we’ve heard,<br>
To the world we all must go,<br>
Nourished by the bread of life,<br>
To the world we go.<br>
### ***Chorus:*** <br>
**Altogether in one love and faith,**<br>
**Seeking ever to be true,**<br>
**You will guide us on the path, O Lord,**<br>
**Of eternal peace.**<br>

With our joys and with our cares,<br>
To the world we all must go,<br>
Weighed by toil but raised by hope,<br>
To the world we go.<br>

Joined in peace and unity,<br>
To the world we all must go,<br>
Gathered in your charity,<br>
To the world we go.<br>
<br>
# X.14 <span> HUNGRY, THIRSTY, LORD, WE CAME<br>
### ***Chorus: ***<br>
**Hungry, thirsty, Lord, we came,**<br>
**But joyous now we leave,**<br>
**Nourished by the bread of life,**<br>
**Renewed and ready to serve.**<br>

Together we have shared this meal.<br>
The bread of unity.<br>
Help us, Lord, to build a world,<br>
Where love and charity abide.<br>

You told us, Lord, to be the light<br>
That shines for all to see.<br>
Send your Spirit in our hearts<br>
To keep the fire of love ablaze.<br>

You called us, Lord, to be the salt,<br>
The leaven in the dough.<br>
Help your witnesses to stand<br>
And speak the words of truth and life.<br>
<br>
# X.19 <span> GO, THE MASS IS ENDED<br>
Go the mass is ended, children of the Lord.<br>
Take his word to others as you’ve heard it<br>
spoken to you,<br>
Go the Mass is ended, go and tell the world:<br>
The Lord is good, the Lord is kind,<br>
And he loves every one.<br>

Go, the Mass is ended, take his love to all.<br>
Gladden all who meet you,<br>
Fill their hearts with hope and courage.<br>
Go, the Mass is ended, fill the world with love:<br>
And give to all what you’ve received:<br>
The peace and joy of Christ.<br>

Go, the Mass is ended, strengthened in the Lord,<br>
Lighten every burden,<br>
Spread the joy of Christ around you,<br>
Go, the Mass is ended, take his peace to all.<br>
This day is yours to change the world,<br>
To make God known and loved.<br>
<br>
# X.23 <span> PUT ON THE ARMOUR<br>
### ***Chorus:*** <br>
**Put on the armour of Jesus Christ,**<br>
**Build up your strength in the Lord.**<br>
**Gird yourself with his truth,**<br>
**carry faith as a shield,**<br>
**The Good news a sword in your hand.**<br>

Let your loins be girt and your lamps alight,<br>
Waiting for the day when the Master comes.<br>
May he find you watching when he returns:<br>
He’ll come like a thief in the night.<br>

If we die with him, we shall live with him.<br>
If we now endure, we shall reign with him,<br>
If we are not faithful, he’ll still keep faith<br>
For he can’t be false to himself.<br>
<br>
# X.27 <span> I'LL SING YOUR GLORY<br>
**I’ll sing your glory, my God,**<br>
**I’ll sing your glory evermore (2).**<br>

I’ll sing your glory, glory, glory evermore (2).<br>
	
I’ll spread your message, spread your message everywhere (2).<br>

I’ll serve your people, serve your people lovingly (2).<br>
<br>
# X.28 <span> RING OUT YOUR JOY<br>
### ***Chorus:*** <br>
**Ring out your joy, give glory to God.**<br>
**Lift up your hearts and sing.**<br>
**Let all creation tell of his name.**<br>
**Praise Him for evermore.**<br>

Blessed are you, God of our fathers,<br>
Glory and praise for evermore.<br>

# X.31 <span> COLOURS OF DAY<br>
Colours of day dawn into the mind,<br>
The Sun has come up, the night is behind.<br>
Go down to the city, into the street<br>
And let’s give the message to the people we meet.<br>

### ***Chorus:*** <br>
**So light up the fire and let the flame burn,**<br>
**Open the door, let Jesus return.**<br>
**Take seeds of His Spirit, let the fruit grow,**<br>
**Tell the people of Jesus, let his love show.**<br>

Go through the park, on into the town,<br>
The sun still shines on, it never goes down.<br>
The light of the world is risen again,<br>
The people of darkness are needing our friend.<br>

Open your eyes, look into the sky,<br>
The darkness has come, the sun came to die,<br>
The evening draws on, the sun disappears;<br>
But Jesus is living and His Spirit is near.
