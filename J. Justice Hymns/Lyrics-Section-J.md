J.2<br>
Deep, deep in the human heart<br>
nie fire of justice burns:<br>
A vision of a world renewed<br>
Through radical concerns.<br>

As Christians we are called<br>
To set the captive free,<br>
To overthrow the evil powers and<br>
end hypocrisy.<br>

This this is our task today:<br>
To build a world of peace.<br>
A world of justice, freedom, truth<br>
Where kindness will increase.<br>

Free, free us from selfishness,<br>
Help us at last to share,<br>
To banish hunger from the earth,<br>
Let every person care.<br>

Give, give us the grace to work<br>
As one community,<br>
To bring new hope and fuller life<br>
To all humanity.<br>

Lord, taking the step of faith,<br>
We leave the past behind<br>
And move into the future's world<br>
With open heart and mind.<br>
<br>
J.3<br>
Lord, we pray for golden peace.<br>
Peace all over the land,<br>
Let us dwell in liberty,<br>
Walking hand in hand.<br>

Banish fear and ignorance, hunger, thirst and pain.<br>
Banish hate and poverty. let no one live in vain.<br>

Keep us all tor ever one, one in love and grace,<br>
Wipe away all war and strife,<br>
give livedotn to each race.<br>

Let your justice reign supreme and<br>
righteousness be done.<br>
Let goodness rule the hearts of all,<br>
evil be overcome.<br>
<br>
J.4<br>

Make us true people to all those in need,<br>
Filled with compassion in thought, word and deed,<br>
Loving our neighbour whatever the cost,<br>
Feeding the hungry and finding the lost. (2)<br>

Lord. make us prophets to cry out the way,<br>
Telling the nations of mercy's new day:<br>
Let us break barriers of hatred and scorn,<br>
Speaking of hope to all people forlorn. (2)<br>

Lord, make us healers of body and mind,<br>
Give us your power to bring sight to the blind,<br>
Love to the loveless and gladness for pain,<br>
Filling all hearts with the joy of your name. (2)<br>
<br>
J.5<br>
God loves the poor, God loves the rich,<br>
But calls us all to share.<br>

This is the living Word of God.<br>
This is the life of Christ in us.<br>
This is the way of life.<br>

The love of God shall liberate<br>
All systems, minds and hearts.<br>

All life on earth has unity<br>
Within the love of God.<br>

Our work for just and lasting peace<br>
Shall help God's new age come.<br>

Praise God in joy, praise God in pain.<br>
Praise God for evermore.<br>
<br>
J.6<br>
Choose life and turn from death,<br>
Make peace instead of war,<br>
Share love in place of hate,<br>
And dance with God the new world's life.<br>

See beauty with your eyes,<br>
Make beauty with your hands,<br>
Live beauty in your lives, and dance...<br>

Seek justice for the poor,<br>
Find freedom for yourself,<br>
Help people use their power, and dance...<br>

Choose love instead of law,<br>
Choose change instead of guilt,<br>
Choose dreams instead of fear, and dance...
