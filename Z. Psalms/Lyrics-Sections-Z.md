# Z.1<span> WE SHALL NOT BE MOVED<br>

How blessed are the ones who never walk<br>
Within the place where wicked scoffers talk.<br> 
We’re like a tree that’s planted by the water:<br>
We shall not be moved !<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**We shall not be, we shall not be moved! (2)**<br>
**We’re like a tree that’s planted by the water:**<br>
**We shall not be moved.**<br>

Our joy is in the statutes of the Lord,<br>
And night and day we ponder on the Word...<br>

The wicked shall not stand the judgment day,<br>
But like the chaff they'll all be blown away...<br>

Sing glory be to God the Father, Son,<br>
And Holy Spirit, ever three in one...<br>
<br>
# ZZ.1<span> BLEST ARE THEY WHO DELIGHT<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Blest are they who delight**<br>
**in the law of the Lord.**<br>

Happy indeed are the ones<br>
Who follow not the counsel of the wicked,<br>
nor linger in the way of sinners,<br>
nor sit in the company of scorners,<br>
But who delight in the law of the Lord<br>
and who ponder his law day and night.<br>

They are like trees that are planted<br>
beside the flowing waters,<br>
 that yield their fruits in due season<br> 
and whose leaves shall never fade;<br>
and all that they do shall prosper.<br>
Not so are the wicked, not so!<br>

For they like winnowed chaff,<br> 
shall be driven away by the wind.<br> 
When the wicked are judged, they shall not stand,<br>
nor find room among those who are just,<br>
for the Lord guards the way of the just,<br>
but the way of the wicked leads to doom.<br>

Give praise to the Father Almighty,<br>
to his Son, Jesus Christ the Lord,<br>
to the Spirit who dwells in our hearts,<br> 
both now and for ever. Amen.<br>
<br>
# (Z)Z.8<span> GREAT IS YOUR NAME, LORD<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Great is your name, Lord,**<br>
**Its majesty fills the earth.**<br>

Your majesty is praised above the heavens;<br>
On the lips of children and of babes.<br>
You have found praise to foil your enemy.<br>
To silence the foe and the rebel.<br>

When I see the heavens, the work of your hands,<br> 
The moon and the stars which you arranged,<br>
What is man that you should keep him in mind,<br>
Mortal man that you care for him?<br>

Yet you have made him little less than a god,<br>
With glory and honour you crowned him.<br>
Gave him power over the works of your hand,<br> 
Put all things under his feet.<br>

Give glory to the Father Almighty,<br>
To his Son, Jesus Christ, the Lord,<br>
To the Spirit who dwells in our hearts,<br> 
Both now and for ever. Amen.<br>
<br>
# Z.21<span> MY GOD, WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME<br>
### ***Chorus-1:***<br>
**Help me, my God,**<br>
**Why have you forsaken me?**<br>
**Why are you so far from my cry?**<br>
### ***Chorus-2:***<br>
**Pierced are my hands,**<br>
**They dug holes in my feet,**<br> 
**Wicked ones have numbered my bones.**<br>

My God, why have you forsaken me?<br>
You are far from the cry of my distress.<br> 
I call by day and you give no reply,<br>
I call by night and find no peace.<br>

But I am a worm and no man,<br>
The butt of all, laughing-stock of the people.<br>
All who see me deride me,<br>
They curl their lips, they toss their heads;<br>
“He trusted in the Lord, let him save him<br>
Let him release him if this is his friend.”<br>

I can count every one of my bones.<br>
These people stare at me and gloat;<br>
They divide my clothing among them.<br>
They cast lots for my robe.<br>

O Lord, do not leave me alone,<br>
My strength, make haste to help me.<br> 
Rescue my soul from the sword,<br>
My life from the grip of these dogs.<br> 
Save my life from the jaws of these lions,<br> 
My poor soul from the horns of the oxen.<br>

### ***Chorus-3:***<br>
**His goodness shall follow me always,**<br>
**to the end of my days.**<br>

My shepherd is the Lord;<br>
There is nothing I shall want,<br>
Fresh and green are the pastures<br>
Where he gives me repose.<br>

Near restful waters he leads me,<br>
To revive my drooping spirit.<br>
He guides me along the right path;<br>
He is true to his name.<br>

If I should walk in the valley of darkness,<br>
No evil would I fear,<br>
You are there with your crook and your staff,<br>
With these you give me comfort.<br>

You have prepared a banquet for me,<br>
In the sight of my foes.<br>
My head you have anointed with oil;<br>
My cup is overflowing.<br>

Surely goodness and kindness shall follow me.<br>
All the days of my life.<br>
In the Lord’s own house shall I dwell<br>
For ever and ever.<br>

To the Father and Son give glory,<br>
Give glory to the Spirit;<br>
To God who is, who was and who will be<br>
For ever and ever.<br>

The world and all its people,<br>

On the waters he made it firm.<br>

Who shall climb the mountain of the Lord?<br>
Who shall stand in his holy place?<br>
Those with clean hands and pure heart,<br>
Who desire not worthless things.<br>

They shall receive blessings from the Lord<br>
And reward from the God who saves them.<br>
Such are the ones who seek him,<br>
Seek the face of the God of Jacob.<br>

Lift up, O gates, your lintels,<br>
Reach up, you, ancient doors,<br>
That the king of glory may enter.<br>
O gates, lift high your heads.<br>

Who is the King of glory?<br>
The Lord, the mighty, the valiant,<br>
The Lord, the valiant in war,<br>
He is the King of glory!<br>

Who is the King of glory?<br>

The earth is the Lord’s and the fullness thereof,<br>
The world and those who dwell therein,<br>
For He has founded it upon the seas,<br>
And established it upon the rivers.<br>

Who shall ascend the hill of the Lord?<br>
And who shall enter his holy place?<br>
Those who have clean hands and a pure heart<br>
And do not lift up their soul to what is false.<br>

Who is this King of glory?<br>
The Lord, strong and mighty,<br>
Mighty in battle, the Lord of hosts,<br>
He is the King of glory.<br>

### ***Chorus-2:***<br>
**Forgive me all my sins, have mercy on me,**<br>
**Protect me, for my hope is in you, Lord.**<br>

To you, Lord, I lift up my soul,<br>
In you do I trust, O my God,<br>
Belie not the trust I have in you,<br>
Let not my foes exult over me.<br>

O Lord, make me know your ways,<br>
O Lord, teach me your paths,<br>
Make me walk in your truth and teach me<br>
For you are God, my Saviour.<br>

Remember your mercy, O Lord,<br>
And the love you have shown from of old.<br>
Remember not the sins of my youth,<br>
In your kindness, O Lord, remember me.<br>

How gracious is the Lord, how faithful,<br>
He shows the path to those who stray,<br>
He guides the humble in the right path,<br>
He teaches his way to the poor.<br>

His ways are faithfulness and love<br>
For those who keep his covenant and will;<br>
O Lord, for the sake of your name,<br>
Forgive my gullt, for it is great.<br>

**He is my light and salvation.**<br>

The Lord is my light and my help,<br>
Whom shall I fear?<br>
The Lord is the stronghold of my life,<br>
before whom shall I shrink?<br>

When evil-doers draw near<br>
to devour my flesh,<br>
it is they, my enemies and foes,<br>
who stumble and fall.<br>

Though an army encamp against me<br>
my heart would not fear;<br>
though war break out against me,<br>
even then would I trust.<br>

O Lord, hear my voice when I call,<br>
have mercy and answer,<br>
Of you my heart has spoken,<br>
“Seek his face”.<br>

It is your face, O Lord, that I seek,<br>
hide not your face.<br>
Dismiss not your servant in anger;<br>
You have been my help!<br>

Do not abandon or forsake me.<br>
O God, my help!<br>
Though father and mother forsake me,<br>
the Lord will receive me.<br>

I am sure I shall see the Lord’s goodness<br>
in the land of the living.<br>

In you, Lord, do I ever seek for help;<br>

and quickly rescue me.<br>

Take me out of the net concealed for me;<br>
my refuge, Lord, you are.<br>
Into your hands I commend my spirit, Lord,<br>
for you are my Redeemer.<br>

I have heard the slander of the crowd<br>
and fear is all around.<br>
Still my trust is not shaken in you, Lord,<br>
I say: "You are my God."<br>

From the power of my foes deliver me,<br>
my fate is in your hand.<br>
Let your face on your faithful servant shine<br>
and save me in your love.<br>

How abundant, how great the goodness, Lord<br>

**Happy the people, whom the Lord**<br>
**has chosen for his own.**<br>
### ***Chorus-3:***<br>
**Learn of me, says the Lord:**<br>
**I am meek and gentle.**<br>

Give thanks to the Lord upon the harp,<br>
with a ten-stringed lute sing him songs!<br>
O sing him a song that is new,<br>
play loudly, with all your skill!<br>

For the word of the Lord is faithful<br>
and all his words to be trusted.<br>
The Lord loves justice and right,<br>
and fills the earth with his love.<br>

By his word the heavens were made,<br>
by the breath of his mouth all the stars,<br>
He collects the waves of the ocean,<br>
he stores up the depths of the sea.<br>

Let all the earth fear the Lord,<br>
all who live in the world revere him.<br>
He spoke; and it came to be.<br>
He commanded; it sprang into being.<br>

He frustrates the designs of the nations,<br>
he defeats the plans of the peoples.<br>
His own designs shall stand for ever,<br>
The plans of his heart from age to age.<br>

They are happy, whose God is the Lord,<br>
the people he has chosen as his own.<br>
From the heavens the Lord looks forth.<br>
He sees all the children of the world.<br>

From the place where he dwells,<br>
he gazes on all the dwellers on the earth,<br>
he who shapes the hearts of them all,<br>
who considers all their deeds.<br>

A king is not saved by his army,<br>
Nor a warrior preserved by his strength.<br>
A vain hope for safety is the horse;<br>
despite its power it cannot save.<br>

The Lord looks on those who revere him,<br>
on those who hope in his love,<br>
to rescue their souls from death,<br>
to keep them alive in famine.<br>

Our soul is waiting for the Lord.<br>
The Lord is our help and our shield.<br>
In him do our hearts find joy.<br>
We trust in his holy name.<br>

May your love be upon us, O Lord,<br>
as we place all our hope in you.<br>
To the Father, the Son and Holy Spirit<br>
give praise for ever. Amen.<br>

I sought the Lord’s help and He answered me,<br>
He set me free from all my terrors.<br>
Look towards Him and shine with joy:<br>
No longer hang your head in shame.<br>

Here was a poor wretch who cried to the Lord,<br>
He heard him and saved him from his troubles.<br>
The angel of the Lord is on guard<br>
Round those who fear Him and rescues them.<br>

Taste then and see that the Lord is good;<br>
Happy the one who trusts in Him.<br>
Fear the Lord, all you his holy peoples,<br>
For those who fear Him, lack nothing.<br>

My soul is thirsting for God,<br>
the God of my life;<br>
When can I enter and see<br>
the face of God?<br>

My tears have become my bread,<br>
by night, by day,<br>
as I hear it said all day long:<br>
“Where is your God?”<br>

By day the Lord will send<br>
his loving kindness;<br>
by night I will sing to him,<br>
Praise the God of my life.<br>

I will say to God, my Rock,<br>
“Why have you forgotten me?<br>
Why do I go mourning,<br>
Oppressed by the foe?”<br>

With cries that pierce me to the heart,<br>
my enemies revile me,<br>
Saying to me all day long:<br>
“Where is your God?”<br>

Why are you cast down, my soul,<br>
why groan within me?<br>
Hope in God, I will praise him still,<br>
my Saviour and my God.<br>

rescue me, O God.<br>

Since you, O God, are my stronghold,<br>
Why have you rejected me?<br>
Why do I go mourning,<br>
Oppressed by the foe?<br>

O send forth your light and your truth,<br>
let these be my gulde;<br>
let them bring me to your holy mountain,<br>
to the place where you dwell.<br>

And I will come to the altar of God,<br>
The God of my joy.<br>
My Redeemer, I will thank you on the harp,<br>
O God, my God!<br>

Why are you cast down, my soul,<br>
why groan within me?<br>
Hope in God, I will praise him still,<br>

The rulers of the earth belong to God,<br>

Have mercy on me, God, in your kindness.<br>
In your compassion blot out my offence.<br>
O wash me more and more from my guilt<br>
and cleanse me from my sin.<br>

My offences truly I know them;<br>
my sin is always before me.<br>
Against you, you alone, have I sinned;<br>
what is evil in your sight I have done.<br>

That you may be justified<br>
when you give sentence<br>
and be without reproach when you judge,<br>
O see, in guilt I was born,<br>
a sinner was I conceived.<br>

Indeed you love truth in the heart;<br>
then in the secret of my heart teach me wisdom.<br>
O purify me, then I shall be clean;<br>
O wash me, I shall be whiter than snow.<br>

Make me hear rejoicing and gladness,<br>
that the bones you have crushed may thrill.<br>
From my sins turn away your face<br>
and blot out all my guilt.<br>

A pure heart create for me, O God,<br>
put a steadfast spirit within me.<br>
Do not cast me away from your presence,<br>
nor deprive me of your holy Spirit.<br>

Give me again the joy of your help;<br>
with a spirit of fervour sustain me,<br>
that I may teach transgressors your ways<br>
And sinners may return to you.<br>

O rescue me, God, my helper,<br>
And my tongue shall ring out your goodness.<br>
O Lord, open my lips and my mouth<br>

burnt offering from me you would refuse;<br>

My heart is anxious, full of whirling thoughts;<br>
the fear of death stands over me.<br>

Had I but wings, as doves have wings,<br>
I cry, to fly away and be at rest!<br>

If only I could wander far away<br>
and in the desert make my home!<br>

But I will call upon the Lord, my God.<br>
The Lord will save me from despair.<br>

At evening, morn and noon, I will lament,<br>
My supplication he will hear!<br>

The Lord will surely free my soul in peace,<br>
from those who war against my life.<br>

The Lord will hear my voice and bring them low,<br>

in the shadow of your wings I rejoice.<br>
My soul clings to you,<br>
Your right hand holds me fast.<br>

Those who seek to destroy my life<br>

shall pay him tribute.<br>

The kings of Sheba and Seba<br>
shall bring him gifts.<br>
Before him all kings shall fall prostrate,<br>
all nations shall serve him.<br>

For he shall save the poor when they cry,<br>
and the needy who are helpless.<br>
He will have pity on the weak<br>

They will see the God of gods in Sion.<br>

O Lord, God of hosts, hear my prayer.<br>
Give ear, O God of Jacob.<br>
Turn your eyes, O God, our shield,<br>
look on the face of your anointed.<br>

One day within your courts<br>
is better than a thousand elsewhere.<br>
The threshold of the house of God<br>
I prefer to the dwellings of the wicked.<br>

For the Lord God is a rampart, a shield;<br>
he will give us his favour and glory.<br>
The Lord will not refuse any good<br>
to those who walk without blame.<br>

It is good to give thanks to the Lord,<br>
to make music to your name, O most high.<br>

To proclaim your love in the morn and<br>
your truth in the watches of the night.<br>

On the ten-stringed lyre and the lute,<br>
with the murmuring sound of the harp.<br>

For you gladden me, Lord, with your deeds;<br>
for the work of your hands, I rejoice.<br>

O Lord, how great are your works,<br>
how deep your thoughts, your designs!<br>

Senseless people cannot know your intent<br>
nor the fools your deeds understand.<br>

But the just will flourish like the palm-tree,<br>
They will grow like a Lebanon cedar.<br>

Like trees planted in the house of the Lord,<br>
they will flourish in the courts of the Lord.<br>

In old age they shall still bear fruit,<br>
still remaining fresh and green, full of sap.<br>

To proclaim that the Lord is just,<br>
He, my rock, in whom no wrong can be found.<br>

the waters have lifted up their voice,<br>
the waters have lifted up their thunder.<br>

Greater than the roar of mighty waters.<br>
More glorious than the surgings of the sea,<br>
the Lord is glorious on high.<br>

Truly, your decrees are to be trusted.<br>

when your fathers put me to the test.<br>

For forty years I was wearied of these people<br>
and said: “their hearts are astray.”<br>
Then I took an oath in my anger:<br>
“They shall never enter my rest.”<br>

My soul, give thanks to the Lord,<br>

It is he who forgives all your guilt,<br>
who heals every one of your ills,<br>

who crowns you with love and compassion.<br>

Who fills your life with good things,<br>
renewing your youth like an eagle’s.<br>

Gives judgement for all who are oppressed.<br>

He made known his ways to Moses<br>
and his deeds to Israel’s sons.<br>

His wrath will come to an end,<br>
he will not be angry for ever.<br>
He does not treat us according to our sins,<br>
nor repay us according to our faults.<br>

For as the heavens are high above the earth,<br>
so strong is his love for those who fear him.<br>
As far as the east is from the west,<br>
so far does he remove our sins.<br>

As a father has compassion on his children,<br>
the Lord has pity on those who fear him.<br>
For he knows of what we are made,<br>
he remembers that we are dust.<br>

As for us, our days are like grass,<br>
we flower like the flower of the field;<br>
One gust of wind, and we are gone<br>
and our place never sees us again.<br>

But the love of the Lord is everlasting<br>
upon those who hold him in fear;<br>
and age after age he will do justice<br>
to those who keep his covenant in truth.<br>

Carrying the seed for the sowing;<br>
They come back, they come back, full of song,<br> 
Carrying their sheaves.<br>
