# G.7 <span> MOTHER OF GOD, PLEAD WITH YOUR SON<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Mother of God Plead with your Son,**<br>
**Pray for us sinners, Mary most pure.**<br>

May God pour cleansing streams over us,<br> 
Washing our souls from every stain.<br>

May God his Spirit breathe into us,<br>
Open our graves and bring us to life.<br>

May he remove our stony hearts,<br>
Give us a heart of flesh in its stead.<br>

May we incline our minds to his voice,<br>
That we may bend our hearts to his will.<br>

May he renew the strength of the weak,<br>
And be the hope of wavering wills.<br>

That he may wipe away every tear,<br>
And make his Light to shine on our face.<br>
<br>
# G.11<span> GRANT TO US<br>

**Grant to us, O Lord, a heart renewed;**<br>
**Recreate in us, your own Spirit, Lord.**<br>
<br>
### ***Chorus-2:***<br>
**Grant to us, O Lord our God,**<br>
**Grant a heart renewed.**<br>
**Recreate in us today**<br>
**the Spirit of your Son.**<br>

Behold, the days are coming,<br>
says the Lord our God,<br>
When I will make a new covenant<br>
with the house of Israel.<br>

Deep within their being<br>
I will implant my law;<br>
I will write it in their hearts.<br>

I will be their God, and<br>
they shall be my people.<br>

And for all their faults<br>
I will grant forgiveness;<br>
Never more will I remember their sins.<br>
<br>
## G.19<span> FORGIVE MY SINS / Psalm 50<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Forgive my sins, O Lord.**<br>

In your kindness, have merc,y on me God,<br>
In your tenderness, wipe away my faults.<br>

Wash me clean, cleaner yet from my guilt.<br>
And cleanse me from my sin, O Lord.<br>

My offences, I know them, O Lord,<br>
and my sins I have constantly in mind.<br>

Against you, Lord, you alone have I sinned,<br>
What is evil in your sight I have done.<br>

Restore to me, O Lord, the joy of your salvation,<br>
Let the bones you have crushed rejoice again.br>

God, may Saviour, deliver me from death<br>
And my tongue will sing aloud your praises.<br>

Here my sacrifice: a broken spirit, Lord,<br>
A humble contrite heart you will not spurn.<br>
<br>
# G.21<span> HEAR MY CRY<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Hear my cry, O Lord, my God,**<br>
**Listen to my prayer;**<br>
**From the earth’s end I call to you**<br>
**When my heart is faint.**<br>

Set me high on  a rock,<br>
You are my refuge, O Lord.<br>

Let me stay in your tent,<br>
Safe in the shade of your wings.<br>

I will echo your praise,<br>
Pay my vows day after day.<br>
<br>
# G.22<span> WALK WITH ME<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Walk with me, O my Lord,**<br>
**Through the darkest night and brightest day.**<br>
**Be at my side, O Lord,**<br>
**Hold my hand and guide me on my way.**<br>

Sometimes the road seems long,<br>
my energy is spent.<br>
Then, Lord, I think of you<br>
and I am given strength.<br>

Stones often bar my path<br>
and there are times I fall<br>
But you are always there<br>
to help me when I fall.<br>

Just as you calmed the wind<br>
and walked upon the sea,<br>
Conquer, my living Lord,<br>
the storms that threaten me.<br>

Help me to pierce the mists<br>
that cloud my heart and mind<br>
So that I shall not fear<br>
the steepest mountain side.<br>

As once you healed the lame<br>
and gave sight to the blind,<br>
Help me when I’m downcast<br>
to hold my head up high.<br>
<br>
# G.23<span> GREAT THINGS HAPPEN<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Great things happen when God mixes with us (2)**<br>
**Great and beautiful, wonderful things:**<br>
**Great things happen when God mixes with us.**<br>

Some find life, some find peace:<br>
Some people also find joy.<br>
Some see things as they never could before,<br>
And some people find<br>
that they can now begin to trust.<br>

Some find health, some find hope:<br>
Some people also find joy.<br>
Some see themselves as they never could before,<br>
And some people find<br>
that they can now begin to live.<br>

Some find peace, some are disturbed;<br>
Some people also find joy.<br>
Some see their lives as they never could before.<br>
And some people find<br>
that they must now begin to change.<br>
<br>
# G.27<span> I HAVE ROAMED<br>

I have roamed, I have groped in the night,<br>
I have stumbled on paths without light,<br>
Still I know I could walk without fear:<br>
You were there by my side always near!<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**For this, I thank you, Lord,**<br>
**Yes, Lord, for the gift of your life!**<br>

There were times in my life when I cried,<br>
When I cheated, offended and lied.<br>
Yet, O Lord, all my sins you forgave:<br>
Not to judge did you come but to save.<br>

If one day I forget, O Lord,<br>
If the zeal for your house is no more,<br>
Then I’m sure you will come, O my friend,<br>
To increase my weak faith once again.<br>
<br>
# G.29<span> FEAR NOT<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Fear not, for I am with you (2)**<br>
**Be not dismayed (2)**<br>
**for I am your God.**<br>

I will strengthen you, I will help you (2)<br>
Yes, I will uphold you,<br>
I will uphold you with my victorious right hand.<br>

I will direct you, I will guide you (2)<br>
Yes, I will protect you….<br>

I will comfort you, I will save you (2)<br>
Yes, I will revive you….<br>

I will gather you, I will feed you (2)<br>
Yes, I will sustain you…<br>

I will raise you up on the last day (2)<br>
Yes, I will redeem you….<br>
<br>
# G.31<span> YES, I SHALL ARISE<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Yes, I shall arise and return to my Father,**<br>
**I will say: “I have sinned, I have sinned”.**<br>

Father, against you alone have I sinned.<br>
How can I ever be called your child?<br>
Treat me as one of your servants, O Lord.<br>
Accept me as a slave.<br>

Thank you, my Father, for giving me light,<br>
Courage and strength to return to you.<br>
Give me again, Lord, the joy your help,<br>
And make me walk aright.<br>

Praise to you, Father: you’ve shown me your love.<br>
Love that has raised me from death to life,<br>
Filling my heart with the Spirit of Christ<br>
To be your child once more.<br>
<br>
# G.36<span> THOUGH THE MOUNTAINS<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Though the mountains may fall**<br>
**and the hills turn to dust,**<br>
**Yet the love of the Lord will stand**<br>
**As a shelter for all who will call on his name:**<br>
**Sing the praise and the glory of God.**<br>

Could the Lord ever leave you?<br>
Could the Lord forget his love?<br>
Though a mother forsake her child,<br>
He will not abandon you.<br>

Should you turn and forsake Him,<br>
He will gently call your name.<br>
Should you wander away from Him,<br>
He will always take you back.<br>

Go to Him when you’re weary;<br>
He will give you eagle’s wings.<br>
You will run, never tire.<br>
For your God will be your strength.<br>

As He swore to your fathers,<br>
When the flood destroyed the land.<br>
He will never forsake you;<br>
He will swear to you again.<br>
<br>
# G.39<span> HOW MUCH LONGER, LORD / Psalm 12<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**How much longer will you hide yourself from me?**<br>
**How long must I face this struggle?**<br>
**How much longer will this sorrow fill my heart?**<br>
**How long must I fight this battle?**<br>

Look at me, O Lord, and answer,<br>
Give me back my strength, don’t let me die.<br>
Never let my foes begin to laugh at me,<br>
Never let my sins just weigh me down.<br>

I will lean on you, O Lord my God.<br>
I will sing for joy because you’ll save me.<br>
I rely on love, your never changing love,<br>
You have been so good so I’ll rejoice.<br>
<br>
# G.41<span> MERCY, LORD<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Mercy, Lord, we have sinned, listen to our plea,**<br>
**Mercy, Lord, we have sinned, answer now our prayer.**<br>

We have turned form the poor, let the hungry die,<br>
We neglect the oppressed, we ignore their cry.<br>
Now’s the time, now’s the day, turn back to your God,<br>
Tear your hearts, cry to Him; Spare your people, Lord!<br>

We confess, we detest our disunity.<br>
We have lived for ourselves, failed in charity.<br>
Banish, Lord, from our hearts bitterness and pain.<br>
Cleanse, us Lord, heal our lives with your Spirit’s flame.<br>
<br>
# G.52<span> YOU BE MY LIGHT, O LORD<br>

When the sun has set and the night is on,<br>
When the darkness falls and the light has gone,<br>
You be my light, O Lord, and lead on. (2)<br>

When I’m growing weak and my steps are slow<br>
When the hopes are bleak and I’ve strength no more,<br>
You be my strength, O Lord, and lead on. (2)<br>

When my eyes grow dim and I cannot see<br>
When a chance is slim of a friend for me,<br>
You be my friend, O Lord, and lead on. (2)<br>

When I cannot talk for there’s no one here<br>
And I cannot walk though the end is near,<br>
 You be my rest, O Lord, and lead on. (2)<br>
<br>
# G.53<span> COMING HOME<br>

I’ve wandered far away from God,<br>
Now I’m coming home.<br>
The paths of sin too long I’ve trod,<br>
Lord, I’m coming home.<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
Coming home, coming home,<br>
never more to roam!<br>
Open wide Thine arms of love,<br>
Lord, I’m coming home.<br>

I’ve wasted many precious years, now….<br>
I now repent with bitter tears, Lord..<br>

I’m tired of sin and straying, Lord, Now…<br>
I’ll trust Thy love, believe Thy word, Lord…<br>

My soul is sick, my heart is sore, Now..<br>
My strength renew, my hope restore, Lord…<br>
<br>
# G.54<span> COME BACK, MY LOVE<br>

There are times, when I have wandered,<br>
There are days so steeped in sin,<br>
There are times when I have floundered<br>
For there’s  darkness deep within.<br>
Now’s the time for my returning,<br>
Far from you I’ve strayed away,<br>
For your love my heart is longing<br>
And that time must be today!<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**"Come back, my love", you call me,**<br>
**"Come back to me and stay,**<br>
**My heart is full of mercy,**<br>
**For the sinner who goes astray."**<br>

All the past is now forgotten,<br>
And with you a new day dawns,<br>
Though your heart my sin has broken,<br>
Yet your love goes on and on.<br>
And I try to hide my feeling,<br>
Though I know where I belong.<br>
Of your love my heart keeps singing<br>
In a never ending song!<br>

For the sins I had committed<br>
All my tears have washed away,<br>
In your love I have confided,<br>
In your arms you let me stay.<br>
But the world keeps always judging,<br>
For my heart it does not see,<br>
Only you with eyes so searching<br>
See the change of heart in me!
