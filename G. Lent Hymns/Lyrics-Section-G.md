# G.1<span> YES, I SHALL ARISE<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Yes, I shall arise and return to my Father!**<br>

To you, O Lord, I lift up my soul,<br>
In you, O my God, I place all my trust.<br>

Look down on me, have mercy, O Lord,<br>
Forgive me my sins, behold all my grief.<br>

My heart and soul shall yearn for your face,<br>
Be gracious to me and answer my plea.<br>

Do not withhold your goodness from me;<br>
O Lord, may your love be deep in my soul.<br>

To you I pray, have pity on me;<br>
My God, I have sinned against your great love.<br>

Mercy I cry, O Lord, wash me clean,<br>
And whiter than snow my spirit shall be.<br>

Give me again the joy of your help;<br>
Now open my lips, your praise I will sing.<br>

Happy are they forgiven by God,<br>
Their sins blotted out, their guilt is no more.<br>
<br>
# G.2<span> O LORD, BE NOT MINDFUL<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**O Lord, be not mindful of our guilt and our sins,**<br>
**O Lord, do not judge us for our faults and offences.**<br>
**May your merciful love be upon us.**<br>

Help your people, Lord, O God our Saviour,<br>
Deliver us for the glory of your name.<br>

Pardon us, O Lord, all our sins,<br>
Deliver us for the glory of your name.<br>

Praise to you, O Lord,<br>
through all ages without end,<br>
Deliver us for the glory of your name.<br>
<br>
# G.5<span> ACCEPT ME, MY LORD<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Accept me, my Lord, accept me**<br>
**for this while,**<br>
**Accept me, my Lord.**<br>

Let those orphaned days that passed<br>
Without Thee, be forgotten.<br>

Only spread this little moment wide across thy lap,<br>
Holding it under thy light.<br>

I have wandered in pursuit of voices<br>
That drew me, yet led me nowhere.<br>

Now let me sit in peace and listen to thy words<br>
In the soul of my silence.<br>

Do not turn away thy face<br>
From my heart's dark secrets,<br>
But burn them till they are alight with thy fire.<br>
<br>
# G.7 <span> MOTHER OF GOD, PLEAD WITH YOUR SON<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Mother of God Plead with your Son,**<br>
**Pray for us sinners, Mary most pure.**<br>

May God pour cleansing streams over us,<br> 
Washing our souls from every stain.<br>

May God his Spirit breathe into us,<br>
Open our graves and bring us to life.<br>

May he remove our stony hearts,<br>
Give us a heart of flesh in its stead.<br>

May we incline our minds to his voice,<br>
That we may bend our hearts to his will.<br>

May he renew the strength of the weak,<br>
And be the hope of wavering wills.<br>

That he may wipe away every tear,<br>
And make his Light to shine on our face.<br>
<br>
# G.11<span> GRANT TO US<br>

### ***Chorus-2:***<br>
**Grant to us, O Lord our God,**<br>
**Grant a heart renewed.**<br>
**Recreate in us today**<br>
**the Spirit of your Son.**<br>

Behold, the days are coming,<br>
says the Lord our God,<br>
When I will make a new covenant<br>
with the house of Israel.<br>

Deep within their being<br>
I will implant my law;<br>
I will write it in their hearts.<br>

I will be their God, and<br>
they shall be my people.<br>

And for all their faults<br>
I will grant forgiveness;<br>
Never more will I remember their sins.<br>
<br>
# G.12<span> RETURN, O LORD / Psalm 6<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Return, O Lord, deliver my soul. (a)**<br>
**God of love, come to my help! (b)**<br>

Gracious Lord, reprove me not in your anger,<br>
Heal me, Lord, for I have no strength.<br>
See, my soul is deeply disturbed. (b)<br>

Every night my bed is drenched with my weeping<br>
And my eyes waste away with grief.<br>
Many are the foes that surround me. (b)<br>

But the Lord has heard the sound of my weeping;<br>
Now at last he has heard my plea<br>
And he has accepted my prayer. (b)<br>
<br>
# G.13<span> HAVE MERCY, HEAL ME / Psalm 40<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Have mercy, heal me,**<br>
**For I have sinned against you.**<br>

O Lord, take pity on your child,<br>
For I have sinned against you.<br>
Keep me safe, rescue me, when disaster strikes.<br>

My foes are speaking ill of me, For...<br>
"O how long before he dies,<br>
and his name with him?"<br>

They come to me with empty words, For...<br>
While their hearts, full of spite,<br>
plot against my life.<br>

They stand, my foes devising hurt, For...<br>
Reckoning I deserve all that I endure.<br>

"Some fatal sickness holds him down", For...<br>
"He lies ill, never more will he rise again."<br>

My friend has turned away from me, For...<br>
Those who shared their bread with me,<br>
have abandoned me.<br>

But you, O Lord, will raise me up, For...<br>
This I know you are my friend;<br>
I shall be unharmed.<br>
<br>
# G.16<span> ALL YOU THAT LABOUR<br>

All you that labour and are burdened,<br>
O come to me.<br>

To you, O Lord, we raise our hands in prayer.<br>
When darkness shrouds your joy,<br>
Stand firm by my side;<br>
You will be strong in your faith.<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
Yes, Lord, we believe<br>
That you have the words of eternal life.<br>

All you that stumble on the way,<br>
O come to me; To you, O Lord...<br>
Good shepherd of my sheep,<br>
On safe paths I lead;<br>
All will return to the fold. Yes...<br>

All you that hunger now and thirst,<br>
O come to me. To you, O Lord...<br>
I am the living bread<br>
I give up my life.<br>
Bringing salvation to the world. Yes...<br>

All you that seek the God of peace,<br>
O come to me, To you, O Lord...<br>
I am the Son of God,<br>
The Father dwells in me,<br>
Source of all life, source of joy. Yes...<br>
<br>
# G.18<span> UNLESS A GRAIN OF WHEAT<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Unless a grain of wheat fall**<br>
**in the ground and die,**<br>
**It remains alone. But if it dies,**<br>
**Then it yields a mighty harvest.**<br>

I have come to bring fire to the earth<br>
And how I wish it were blazing already.<br>

Those who worship must worship in spirit<br>
And in truth when they worship the Father.<br>

God's goodness is proclaimed to the poor<br>
And happy those whose faith does not falter.<br>

Don't just say to me: Lord, Lord,<br>
But see you do the will of my Father.<br>

You can forecast the seasons and weather,<br>
Can't you read the signs of your own times?<br>

For our God is the God of the living<br>
And his glory is man fully living.<br>
<br>
## G.19<span> FORGIVE MY SINS / Psalm 50<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Forgive my sins, O Lord.**<br>

In your kindness, have merc,y on me God,<br>
In your tenderness, wipe away my faults.<br>

Wash me clean, cleaner yet from my guilt.<br>
And cleanse me from my sin, O Lord.<br>

My offences, I know them, O Lord,<br>
and my sins I have constantly in mind.<br>

Against you, Lord, you alone have I sinned,<br>
What is evil in your sight I have done.<br>

Restore to me, O Lord, the joy of your salvation,<br>
Let the bones you have crushed rejoice again.br>

God, may Saviour, deliver me from death<br>
And my tongue will sing aloud your praises.<br>

Here my sacrifice: a broken spirit, Lord,<br>
A humble contrite heart you will not spurn.<br>
<br>
# G.20<span> LORD, MY FRIEND<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Lord my friend, you're present to me.**<br>
**You're my life, my strength, O my God.**<br>

In the midst of much affliction,<br>
When I'm feeling lost and helpless.<br>

In the days of painful crises,<br>
When my heart is sad and lonely.<br>

When I'm guilty of offences,<br>
When assailed by strong temptations.<br>

In the happy hours of sunshine,<br>
When my mind is in high spirits.<br>
<br>
# G.21<span> HEAR MY CRY<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Hear my cry, O Lord, my God,**<br>
**Listen to my prayer;**<br>
**From the earth’s end I call to you**<br>
**When my heart is faint.**<br>

Set me high on  a rock,<br>
You are my refuge, O Lord.<br>

Let me stay in your tent,<br>
Safe in the shade of your wings.<br>

I will echo your praise,<br>
Pay my vows day after day.<br>
<br>
# G.22<span> WALK WITH ME<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Walk with me, O my Lord,**<br>
**Through the darkest night and brightest day.**<br>
**Be at my side, O Lord,**<br>
**Hold my hand and guide me on my way.**<br>

Sometimes the road seems long,<br>
my energy is spent.<br>
Then, Lord, I think of you<br>
and I am given strength.<br>

Stones often bar my path<br>
and there are times I fall<br>
But you are always there<br>
to help me when I fall.<br>

Just as you calmed the wind<br>
and walked upon the sea,<br>
Conquer, my living Lord,<br>
the storms that threaten me.<br>

Help me to pierce the mists<br>
that cloud my heart and mind<br>
So that I shall not fear<br>
the steepest mountain side.<br>

As once you healed the lame<br>
and gave sight to the blind,<br>
Help me when I’m downcast<br>
to hold my head up high.<br>
<br>
# G.23<span> GREAT THINGS HAPPEN<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Great things happen when God mixes with us (2)**<br>
**Great and beautiful, wonderful things:**<br>
**Great things happen when God mixes with us.**<br>

Some find life, some find peace:<br>
Some people also find joy.<br>
Some see things as they never could before,<br>
And some people find<br>
that they can now begin to trust.<br>

Some find health, some find hope:<br>
Some people also find joy.<br>
Some see themselves as they never could before,<br>
And some people find<br>
that they can now begin to live.<br>

Some find peace, some are disturbed;<br>
Some people also find joy.<br>
Some see their lives as they never could before.<br>
And some people find<br>
that they must now begin to change.<br>
<br>
# G.25<span> HOSEA<br>

Come back to me with all your heart.<br>
Don't let fear keep us apart.<br>

Trees do bend, though straight and tall;<br>
So must we to others call.<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Long have I waited for your coming home to me**<br>
**And living deeply our new life.**<br>

The wilderness will lead you<br>
To your heart where I will speak.<br>
Integrity and justice<br>
With tenderness you shall know.<br>

You shall sleep secure with peace,<br>
Faithfulness will be your joy.<br>
<br>
# G.27<span> I HAVE ROAMED<br>

I have roamed, I have groped in the night,<br>
I have stumbled on paths without light,<br>
Still I know I could walk without fear:<br>
You were there by my side always near!<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**For this, I thank you, Lord,**<br>
**Yes, Lord, for the gift of your life!**<br>

There were times in my life when I cried,<br>
When I cheated, offended and lied.<br>
Yet, O Lord, all my sins you forgave:<br>
Not to judge did you come but to save.<br>

If one day I forget, O Lord,<br>
If the zeal for your house is no more,<br>
Then I’m sure you will come, O my friend,<br>
To increase my weak faith once again.<br>
<br>
# G.29<span> FEAR NOT<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Fear not, for I am with you (2)**<br>
**Be not dismayed (2)**<br>
**for I am your God.**<br>

I will strengthen you, I will help you (2)<br>
Yes, I will uphold you,<br>
I will uphold you with my victorious right hand.<br>

I will direct you, I will guide you (2)<br>
Yes, I will protect you….<br>

I will comfort you, I will save you (2)<br>
Yes, I will revive you….<br>

I will gather you, I will feed you (2)<br>
Yes, I will sustain you…<br>

I will raise you up on the last day (2)<br>
Yes, I will redeem you….<br>
<br>
# G.31<span> YES, I SHALL ARISE<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Yes, I shall arise and return to my Father,**<br>
**I will say: “I have sinned, I have sinned”.**<br>

Father, against you alone have I sinned.<br>
How can I ever be called your child?<br>
Treat me as one of your servants, O Lord.<br>
Accept me as a slave.<br>

Thank you, my Father, for giving me light,<br>
Courage and strength to return to you.<br>
Give me again, Lord, the joy your help,<br>
And make me walk aright.<br>

Praise to you, Father: you’ve shown me your love.<br>
Love that has raised me from death to life,<br>
Filling my heart with the Spirit of Christ<br>
To be your child once more.<br>
<br>
# G.32<span> FILL ME<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Fill me with your Spirit, Lord, fill me,**<br>
**That my heart may keep praising and**<br>
**my life may be love.**<br>

From the pit, could I sing your praises?<br>
Can the dust ever tell your fame?<br>
Hasten, Lord, let your Spirit heal me,<br>
Then my soul shall be filled with joy.<br>

How can I, when my soul is troubled,<br>
Think of love, when I'm filled with pain?<br>
Thank you, Lord, for your constant friendship<br>
Warms my heart, makes me love again.<br>
<br>
# G.34<span> DO NOT BE AFRAID<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Do not be afraid, do not be afraid.**<br>
**I am with you to bring light to your life!**<br>

Lord, you have called me to this desert place.<br>
Speak to my heart your words of love, tenderly.<br>

Father, behold I come to do your will.<br>
So let the Spirit of your Son breathe in me.<br>

Lord, you have touched my life and I have grown.<br>
You make my spirit turn to you, constantly.<br>
<br>
# G.36<span> THOUGH THE MOUNTAINS<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Though the mountains may fall**<br>
**and the hills turn to dust,**<br>
**Yet the love of the Lord will stand**<br>
**As a shelter for all who will call on his name:**<br>
**Sing the praise and the glory of God.**<br>

Could the Lord ever leave you?<br>
Could the Lord forget his love?<br>
Though a mother forsake her child,<br>
He will not abandon you.<br>

Should you turn and forsake Him,<br>
He will gently call your name.<br>
Should you wander away from Him,<br>
He will always take you back.<br>

Go to Him when you’re weary;<br>
He will give you eagle’s wings.<br>
You will run, never tire.<br>
For your God will be your strength.<br>

As He swore to your fathers,<br>
When the flood destroyed the land.<br>
He will never forsake you;<br>
He will swear to you again.<br>
<br>
# G.38<span> LAY YOUR HANDS<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Lay your hands gently upon us.**<br>
**Let their touch render your peace.**<br>
**Let them bring your forgiveness and healing.**<br>
**Lay your hands, gently lay your hands.**<br>

You were sent to free the brokenhearted.<br>
You were sent to give sight to the blind.<br>
You desire to heal all our illnesses,<br>
Lay your hands, gently lay your hands.<br>

Lord, we come to you through one another.<br>
Lord, we come to you in our need.<br>
Lord, we come to you, seeking wholeness.<br>
Lay your hands, gently lay your hands.<br>
<br>
# G.39<span> HOW MUCH LONGER, LORD / Psalm 12<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**How much longer will you hide yourself from me?**<br>
**How long must I face this struggle?**<br>
**How much longer will this sorrow fill my heart?**<br>
**How long must I fight this battle?**<br>

Look at me, O Lord, and answer,<br>
Give me back my strength, don’t let me die.<br>
Never let my foes begin to laugh at me,<br>
Never let my sins just weigh me down.<br>

I will lean on you, O Lord my God.<br>
I will sing for joy because you’ll save me.<br>
I rely on love, your never changing love,<br>
You have been so good so I’ll rejoice.<br>
<br>
# G.41<span> MERCY, LORD<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Mercy, Lord, we have sinned, listen to our plea,**<br>
**Mercy, Lord, we have sinned, answer now our prayer.**<br>

We have turned form the poor, let the hungry die,<br>
We neglect the oppressed, we ignore their cry.<br>
Now’s the time, now’s the day, turn back to your God,<br>
Tear your hearts, cry to Him; Spare your people, Lord!<br>

We confess, we detest our disunity.<br>
We have lived for ourselves, failed in charity.<br>
Banish, Lord, from our hearts bitterness and pain.<br>
Cleanse, us Lord, heal our lives with your Spirit’s flame.<br>
<br>
# G.42<span> ALL I NEED IS LOVE / Psalm 49<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**All I need is love, (2)**<br>
**I take no delight in your offering,**<br>
**but in a humble heart.**<br>
**All I need is love, (2)**<br>
**All I want is a contrite spirit,**<br>
**all I need is love.**<br>

How can you recite my commandments<br>
And take my covenant on your lips?<br>
You who despise my law<br>
And throw my words to the winds?<br>

You throw your lot with the sinners,<br>
You're always ready to tell lies.<br>
Such are your ways, your deeds,<br>
Should I make no signs and be quiet?<br>

What I really want from my people:<br>
A sincere sacrifice of praise,<br>
The trust that I come to save,<br>
A cry to me in their needs.<br>
<br>
# G.44<span> WHOM DO YOU SEEK?<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Whom do you seek? Whom are you looking for?**<br>
**Whom do you seek? Why do you weep?**<br>

I seek the one who brings peace to my people,<br>
He whose gentleness touches my heart.<br>
He speaks still in the depths of my being.<br>
How I pray that we never shall part!<br>

I seek the one who shows love for all nations<br>
Heals all suffering, offers us peace.<br>
He has promised a life without ending.<br>
Love and laughter and joy will not cease.<br>

I am the one who brings peace to all nations,<br>
I am the one who brings love to you all.<br>
Come to me and your hearts will be restful<br>
I have come to bring life to you all.<br>

I am the One whom you are looking for!<br>
I am the One: have faith in Me!<br>
<br>
# G.45<span> SON OF DAVID<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Son of David, have pity on me,**<br>
**Son of God, hear my plea.**<br>
**O Son of David, have pity on me,**<br>
**Listen to my plea!**<br>

Those who sow in tears and pain,<br>
Will return rejoicing.<br>
The lamb will leap, the lion lie down,<br>
On your day, O Lord.<br>

He has borne our grief and pain,<br>
Burdened down with sorrow.<br>
Who'd believe what we have seen?<br>
Like a lamb He is slain.<br>

By his word this world was made,<br>
Every grain and flower.<br>
The poor stand near to God, the Lord!<br>
Those who seek his face.<br>
<br>
# G.46<span> THOSE WHO WEEP WILL REJOICE / Psalm 126<br>

All your building is vain unless God is the builder,<br>
All your watching is vain unless<br>
God is the watchman!<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Those who weep as they sow,**<br>
**Will rejoice at the harvest.**<br>
**Give your thanks to the Lord**<br>
**Who brings joy out of sorrow.**<br>
**He turns sorrow into joy!**<br>

You may rise before dawn,<br>
seek your bed after nightfall,<br>
And yet labour in vain, for the Lord<br>
gives the increase.<br>

In his love God makes rich by<br>
his present of children,<br>
Who, like arrows in flight,<br>
will be swift to protect you.<br>

What a blessing God gives<br>
in this quiver of arrows!<br>
When the enemy stands<br>
in the gate of the city.<br>
<br>
# G.50<span> COME, JESUS, COME<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Come, Jesus, come into this heart of stone.**<br>
**Melt it and mould it, Lord, make it your own.**<br>

For the Lord looks down from heaven,<br>
He sees all who dwell on earth.<br>
Each and ev'ry heart he fashions,<br>
He observes and discerns its deeds.<br>

Since the heart is most deceitful,<br>
Its ways who can understand?<br>
Only you, O Lord, can test it,<br>
And repay what our deeds deserve.<br>

People judge outward appearance,<br>
But God esteems the heart,<br>
For his Word is like a two-edged sword,<br>
It discerns and lays bare our thoughts.<br>

Many with their words approach me,<br>
They honour me with their lips,<br>
Shame on them: they hide their purpose,<br>
Though they know that their hearts I see.<br>

Rend your hearts and not your garments,<br>
Return to the Lord your God,<br>
He is gracious and compassionate,<br>
Slow to anger and full of love.<br>
<br>
# G.52<span> YOU BE MY LIGHT, O LORD<br>

When the sun has set and the night is on,<br>
When the darkness falls and the light has gone,<br>
You be my light, O Lord, and lead on. (2)<br>

When I’m growing weak and my steps are slow<br>
When the hopes are bleak and I’ve strength no more,<br>
You be my strength, O Lord, and lead on. (2)<br>

When my eyes grow dim and I cannot see<br>
When a chance is slim of a friend for me,<br>
You be my friend, O Lord, and lead on. (2)<br>

When I cannot talk for there’s no one here<br>
And I cannot walk though the end is near,<br>
 You be my rest, O Lord, and lead on. (2)<br>
<br>
# G.53<span> COMING HOME<br>

I’ve wandered far away from God,<br>
Now I’m coming home.<br>
The paths of sin too long I’ve trod,<br>
Lord, I’m coming home.<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
Coming home, coming home,<br>
never more to roam!<br>
Open wide Thine arms of love,<br>
Lord, I’m coming home.<br>

I’ve wasted many precious years, now….<br>
I now repent with bitter tears, Lord..<br>

I’m tired of sin and straying, Lord, Now…<br>
I’ll trust Thy love, believe Thy word, Lord…<br>

My soul is sick, my heart is sore, Now..<br>
My strength renew, my hope restore, Lord…<br>
<br>
# G.54<span> COME BACK, MY LOVE<br>

There are times, when I have wandered,<br>
There are days so steeped in sin,<br>
There are times when I have floundered<br>
For there’s  darkness deep within.<br>
Now’s the time for my returning,<br>
Far from you I’ve strayed away,<br>
For your love my heart is longing<br>
And that time must be today!<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**"Come back, my love", you call me,**<br>
**"Come back to me and stay,**<br>
**My heart is full of mercy,**<br>
**For the sinner who goes astray."**<br>

All the past is now forgotten,<br>
And with you a new day dawns,<br>
Though your heart my sin has broken,<br>
Yet your love goes on and on.<br>
And I try to hide my feeling,<br>
Though I know where I belong.<br>
Of your love my heart keeps singing<br>
In a never ending song!<br>

For the sins I had committed<br>
All my tears have washed away,<br>
In your love I have confided,<br>
In your arms you let me stay.<br>
But the world keeps always judging,<br>
For my heart it does not see,<br>
Only you with eyes so searching<br>
See the change of heart in me!<br>
<br>
# G.55<span> THE LORD IS NEAR<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br><br>
**The Lord is near to all who call on Him.**<br>
**Rest in Him alone, rest in Him alone.**<br>

He will guard your coming and your going,<br>
He will be the one to guard your life.<br>
The sun will not harm you in the daylight,<br>
And the Lord will watch you through the night.<br>

He has seen a thousand years go past Him,<br>
Swiftly as a morning fades to night.<br>
So come, let Him fill you with His wisdom,<br>
To number all your days aright.<br>

Lord, in You I come to take my refuge,<br>
Through the night You ever counsel me.<br>
O Lord, You have formed me to be holy,<br>
And to rest within You PEACEFULLY.<br>

Trust in Him for ever, O my people,<br>
Pour out all your hearts before the Lord.<br>
Your God is a rock of strength, your glory;<br>
In the Lord is all your hope restored.<br>
<br>
# G.58<span> WHAT DOES IT PROFIT A MAN?<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**What does it profit a man,**<br>
**If he gains the whole wide world**<br>
**But suffers the loss of his soul?**<br>
**Yes, suffers the loss of his soul?**<br>

I have spent my whole life in enjoyment,<br>
Good food, good drinks, silk to wear,<br>
With friends who like me let the moments pass<br>
With never a thought or a care. But...<br>

O Lord, I must rise in repentance.<br>
Against Your love have I sinned.<br>
But now is the time to return to You:<br>
I know that Your word makes me free, for...<br>

"Be never the slave of two masters:<br>
You can't serve both God and gold.<br>
Why worry about what to eat and drink?<br>
Your Father knows all that you need", so...<br>

"Provide yourselves with good purses<br>
And save your riches in heav'n,<br>
Where thieves cannot reach neither moth destroy,<br>
You must be rich in God's sight." So...<br>

# G.60<span> BE NOT AFRAID<br>

You shall cross the barren desert,<br>
But you shall not die of thirst.<br>
You shall wander far in safety<br>
Though you do not know the way.<br>
You shall speak your words to foreign people<br>
and they will understand.<br>
You shall see the face of God and live.<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Be not afraid! I go before you always.**<br>
**Come, follow me and I will give you rest.**<br>

If you pass through raging waters<br>
In the sea you shall not drown.<br>
If you walk amid the burning flames,<br>
You shall not be harmed.<br>
If you stand before the pow'r of hell<br>
And death is at your side,<br>
Know that I am with you through it all!<br>

Blessed are the poor,<br>
For the kingdom shall be theirs.<br>
Blest are you that weep and mourn,<br>
For one day you shall laugh.<br>
And if wicked ones insult<br>
And hate you all because of Me,<br>
Blessed, blessed are you!<br>
<br>
# G.62<span> CREATE IN ME<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Create in me a clean heart, O God,**<br>
**And renew a right spirit in me. (2)**<br>

Wash me, cleanse me, purify me,<br>
Make my heart as white as snow.<br>

'Gainst you, Lord, alone I've sinned,<br>
What's evil in your sight I've done.<br>

Let the bone you've crushed rejoice,<br>
My tongue shall sing your praise again.<br>

Here's my sacrifice to you:<br>
A humble, contrite heart, O Lord.
