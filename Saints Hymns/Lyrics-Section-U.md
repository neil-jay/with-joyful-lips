# U.5 <span> TRUST IN THE LORD<br>
### ***Chorus:*** <br>
Trust in the Lord, O you saints of God<br>
And bless His name (2).<br>
Happy are they who trust in Him<br>
And bless His name (2).<br>

Exult, you just, in the Lord our God,<br>
Praise from the upright is fitting.<br>
Sing to Him a new song with the harp,<br>
Pluck the strings with shouts of gladness.<br>

For true indeed is the word of God,<br>
And all his deeds to be trusted.<br>
He loves justice and righteousness.<br>
The earth proclaims his loving kindness.<br>

But see, the eyes of the Lord are trained<br>
On those who hope for his kindness.<br>
Our hearts wait on the living God<br>
Who is our shield and our helper.<br>

For in the Lord all our hearts rejoice.<br>
Holy his name which we trust in.<br>
May your love be upon us, O Lord,<br>
Who have put our hope in you.<br>
