# H.1<span> WE HAIL THEE<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**We hail thee, Saviour and Lord,**<br>
**Thy cross ever be adored!**<br>

O Cross, thou art the fountain<br>
Of love and of liberty:<br>
Shine down upon the millions<br>
Who search for the light of truth.<br>

Look down upon the needy,<br>
Confirm them in strength and grace;<br>
Thou art our true salvation,<br>
In thee, all our hope we place.<br>

Be thou our sign of vict’ry,<br>
Redeem us from sin and strife;<br>
Renew  in us thy passion,<br>
And grant us eternal life.<br>
<br>
# H.3<span> PRAYER TO THE SUFFERING INNOCENT / Psalm 21<br>
### ***Chorus-1:***<br>
**My Father, not my will**<br>
**But yours alone be done.**<br>
### ***Chorus-2:***<br>
**This is my flesh,**<br>
**this the blood I shed for you.**<br>
### ***Chorus-3:***<br>
**My soul does long for you,**<br>
**O Lord, the living God.**<br>

My God, why have you forsaken me;<br>
You are far from the sound of my cry.<br>

I call by day and you give no reply;<br>
I call by night and I find no peace.<br>

In you, our fathers put their trust,<br>
They trusted and you set them free.<br>

But I am a worm and no man,<br>
The butt of men, laughing stock of the people.<br>

All who see me, deride me saying;<br>
"He trusted in the Lord, let him save him".<br>

From my mother's womb you have been my God.<br>
Do not leave me alone in my distress.<br>

Like water I am poured out,<br>
Disjointed are all my bones.<br>

A band of the wicked beset me,<br>
They tear holes in my hands and my feet.<br>

I can count every one of my bones,<br>
They divide my clothing among them.<br>

O Lord, make haste to help me,<br>
I will tell of your name to my brethren.<br>

They shall praise the Lord, those who seek him,<br>
May their hearts live for ever and ever.<br>
<br>
# H.4<span> O CROSS, ERECTED ABOVE THE WORLD<br>

O Cross, erected above the world,<br>
Cross of our Saviour King! (2)<br>
Fount from which gushed the waters<br>
Straight from the wound in his side,<br>
Filling our lives with his gift of grace,<br>
Cross of our Saviour King!<br>

O Cross, sublime and refulgent tree,<br>
Cross of our Saviour King! (2)<br>
Jesus, through thee, has saved us;<br>
Great was the price that he paid.<br>
Thou art the folly of love divine,<br>
Cross of our Saviour King!<br>

O Cross, thou channel of grace divine,<br>
Cross of our Saviour King! (2)<br>
Tree on which death was conquered,<br>
Thou the first altar of love,<br>
Jesus the lamp gave his life on thee,<br>
Cross of our Saviour King!<br>

O Cross, all honour and praise to thee,<br>
Cross of our Saviour King! (2)<br>
Thou art the sign of Vict’ry,<br>
Sign of redemption and life:<br>
Homage and glory belong to thee,<br>
Cross of our Saviour King!<br>
<br>
# H.6<span> THE REPROACHES<br>
### ***Chorus-1:***<br>
**My people, what have I done to you?**<br>
**How have I afflicted you?**<br>
### ***Chorus-2:***<br>
**Holy God, holy and strong!**<br>
**Holy immortal one, have mercy.**<br>

I led you out of Egrpt,<br>
from slavery to freedom<br>
But you led your Saviour to the Cross.<br>

For forty years I led you<br>
safely through the desert.<br>
I fed you with manna from heaven.<br>
And brought you to a land of plenty;<br>
But you led your Saviour to the cross.<br>

What more could I have done for you?<br>
I planted you as my fairest vine,<br>
but you yielded only bitterness:<br>
When I was thirsty you gave me vinegar to drink,<br>
And with a lance you pierced<br>
your Saviour's side. (2)<br>

For your sake I scourged your captors<br>
and their firstborn sons,<br>
But you brought your scourges down on me. (1)<br>

I led you from slavery to freedom<br>
And drowned your captors in the sea,<br>
But to your high priests you handed me over. (1)<br>

I opened the sea before you,<br>
But you opened my side with a spear. (1)<br>

I led you on your way in a pillar of cloud,<br>
But you led me to Pilate's court. (1)<br>

With manna in the desert I bore you up,<br>
But you struck me down and scourged me. (1)<br>

I gave you saving water from the rock,<br>
But you gave me gall and vinegar to drink. (1)<br>

For you I struck down the kings of Canaan,<br>
But with a reed you struck my head. (1)<br>

I gave you a royal sceptre,<br>
But you gave me a crown of thorns. (1)<br>

I raised you to the height of majesty,<br>
But high on a cross, you raised me. (1)<br>
<br>
# HH.8<span> CHRIST BECAME OBEDIENT<br>

Christ became obedient unto death,<br>
unto death, a death upon the cross.<br>
Therefore God has raised Him to the heights,<br>
giving Him a name above all names.<br>
<br>
# H.9<span> YOU WHO PASS BY THE WAY / Psalm 68<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**You who pass by the way, look and see;**<br>
**Was there ever sorrow like mine?**<br>

See how the waters close in on me, shoulder high.<br>
I sink into the deep and Chere is no foothold.<br>
A stranger I became to my brothers and friends:<br>
They have abandoned me and covered me with shame.<br>

Look down upon me, Lord, in your great tendernesS.<br>
Turn not your face away, make haste to answer me.<br>
Draw near in my distress, set me free from my foes.<br>
To you I make my prayer, your help shall never fail.<br>

You know the mocking words and the shame I endure.<br>
My foes are known to you, despair has filled my heart.<br>
I look for comfort where there is none to be found.<br>
They gave me gall to eat and vinegar to drink!<br>

All you who seek the Lord, may your heart live again,<br>
For God does not despise his own that are in need.<br>
Let all the living creatures on earth give Him praise,<br>
For Sion he will save and those who love his name.<br>
<br>
# H.11<span> FROM THE DEPTHS I CALL / Psalm 129<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
From the depths I call to you, O Lord,<br>
Listen to my cry.<br>

Lord, in compassion, listen to my pleading,<br>
Listen, to my cry.<br>
If you refuse, Lord, to forgive your people’s sins,<br>
We would surely die.<br>

So I am waiting, waiting for him patiently,<br>
Hoping in his word,<br>
More than the watchman waiting for the dawn to come,<br>
I await the Lord.<br>

So let us trust him for in him is mercy;<br>
He, the Lord, is kind.<br>
He gives us pardon, generous redemption,<br>
Casts our sins behind.<br>
<br>
H.12<span> BE THIS MIND IN YOU<br>

Be this mind in you, the same that was in Jesus,<br>
Who held not to his glory, but deigned to live with us.<br>
Jesus, Lord, keep this mind in us!<br>

A man with men appearing, a servant he became,<br>
Obedient to the Father, died on the cross of shame.<br>
Jesus, Lord, keep this mind in us!<br>

To him has God then given, above all names, a name,<br>
That every knee shall bend before and every voice acclaim.<br>
Jesus, Lord, keep this mind in us!<br>
<br>
# H.16<span> BE NOT AFRAID<br>

You who are burdened, toil and sweat,<br>
Longing for rest but all in vain,<br>
Be not afraid of sacrifice,<br>
Be not afraid in front of death.<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Lift up your eyes to Jesus Christ,**<br>
**Cry out to him and ne'er despair.**<br>

All you that slip on the way and fall,<br>
Hearts wounded deep and full of woe,<br>
Be not afraid of sacrifice,<br>
Be not afraid in front of death.<br>

All you that weep in prison's cells.<br>
People who flee from home and kin.<br>
Be not afraid of sacrifice,<br>
Be not afraid in front of death.<br>

All you whom strife has torn apart,<br>
People whom one has crucified,<br>
Be not afraid of sacrifice,<br>
Be not afraid in front of death.<br>
<br>
# H.17<span> WERE YOU THERE?<br>

Were you there when they crucified my Lord?<br>
Were you there when they crucified my Lord?<br>
Oh! sometimes it causes me to tremble, tr., tr.,<br>
Were you there when they crucified my Lord?<br>

Were you there when they nailed him to the tree?<br>

Were you there when they pierced him in the side?<br>

Were you there when they laid him in the tomb?<br>
<br>
# H.21<span> FATHER, IF THIS CUP<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Father, if this cup cannot pass away,**<br>
**Unless I drink it, your will be done.**<br>

I came that you may have life<br>
And have it to the full.<br>

All that the Father gives to me,<br>
I share with you.<br>

Every one who believes<br>
Has eternal life.<br>

The Spirit gives new life;<br>
My words are Spirit and life.<br>
<br>
# H.22<span> HE WAS WOUNDED<br>

He was wounded for our transgressions.<br>
He was bruised for our iniquities.<br>
For upon Him, was the chastisement,<br>
The chastisement that made us whole.<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**And by his wounds we are healed (2).**<br>
**For upon Him was the chastisement,**<br>
**The chastisement that made us whole.**<br>
**And by his wounds we are healed (2).**<br>
**Praise the Lord!**<br>

We despised Him, the man of sorrows,<br>
We rejected the man with bitter grief.<br>
Who among us knew He was dying,<br>
He was dying for our own sins?<br>

It was God's plan that He should suffer,<br>
It was God's plan that He should live again.<br>
Thus His servant has won salvation,<br>
Won salvation for all mankind.<br>
<br>
# H.24<span> O MY PEOPLE<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**O my people, O my people,**<br>
**what have done to you?**<br>
**Tell me how, O tell me**<br>
**how have I offended you?**<br>

I led you out of Egypt to freedom,<br>
But to the cross, your Saviour you led.<br>
I brought you to a land of plenty,<br>
But through the streets your Saviour you dragged.<br>

I struck down many kings and nations,<br>
But with a reed you struck my head.<br>
The Red Sea before you I opened,<br>
But with a spear you opened my sides.<br>

I fed you in the desert with manna,<br>
You brought your scourges down on me.<br>
I gave you from the rock saving water,<br>
But to the chief priests you handed me over.<br>

I led you through the desert safely,<br>
But you produced me before Pilate's court.<br>
I raised you to the height of glory,<br>
You raised me high on the cross of shame.<br>
<br>
# H.26<span> FATHER, FORGIVE THEM<br>
### ***Chorus-1:***<br>
Father, forgive them.<br>
They know not what they do.<br>
### ***Chorus-2:***<br>
Father, forgive us.<br>
We know not what we do.<br>

They see me lying in the street<br>
And never lend a hand;<br>
The night goes by while they're asleep,<br>
Yet I'm still in the sand;<br>
And I cry each night for their blinded eyes,<br>
That never, never seem to see. (Ch. 1)<br>

They call me friend when they're in need,<br>
I know it's all a sham,<br>
For when my sufferings make me weep,<br>
They simply wash their hands<br>
And I'm left alone in despair to moan;<br>
They'll never, never understand. (Ch. 2)<br>

We crucified your Son in shame,<br>
His message we ignored;<br>
Though time has passed, we're still the same.<br>
Indifferent as before;<br>
And He dies each day in our hearts of clay;<br>
O Father, teach us how to love. (Ch. 2)<br>
<br>
# H.27<span> HAIL, HOLY CROSS OF OUR SAVIOUR<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Hail, holy Cross of our Saviour,**<br>
**Hail, holy Cross of Christ!**<br>
**On his bleeding shoulder Jesus bore you with love.**<br>
**Hail, holy Cross of our Saviour,**<br>
**Sign of redemption and love.**<br>
**We sing the glory, the power of your name,**<br>
**Thru the Saviour's blood.**<br>

Step by step He bore you with<br>
a heart all filled with love.<br>
Step by step, he went to bring<br>
healing to the world.<br>

Drop by drop like jewels,<br>
His own most precious blood,<br>
Decked your naked wood for the<br>
saving of the world.<br>

When to the tomb you yielded<br>
creation's priceless fruit,<br>
The third day you shone a symbol<br>
of his triumph over death.<br>
<br>
# H.28<span> GLORY TO THE CROSS OF CHRIST<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Sing glory to the cross of Christ,**<br>
**Sing glory, sing glory, sing glory.**<br>

Sign of peace and sign of love,<br>
Glory to the cross of Christ!<br>
Sign of shame to glory raised,<br>
Glory to the cross of Christ!<br>

Cross our gentle Saviour bore...<br>
Cross by which He saved the world...<br>

Cross on which our Saviour died...<br>
Teaching us to die for love...<br>
<br>
# H.29<span> HE WAS DESPISED<br>

He was despised and rejected by all,<br>
A man of sorrows, a man of grief,<br>
As one from whom people hide their faces<br>
He was despised without esteem.<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**But he was wounded for our transgressions**<br>
**And he was tortured for our iniquities**<br>
**And his chastisement has brought us healing**<br>
**And by his scourging we are made whole.**<br>

He had no beauty that we should desire Him,<br>
His form disfigured, a worm, no man!<br>
His comeliness and his beauty had vanished,<br>
For he was scorned, despised, oppressed.<br>

The very stone which the builders rejected<br>
Is now and ever the corner-stone.<br>
Let every knee bend to Jesus, our Saviour,<br>
Each tongue confess that He is Lord!<br>
<br>
# H.31<span> SHOUT, O JERUSALEM / Psalm 23<br>

Shout, O Jerusalem, praise your God,<br>
Zion, sing to Him and bless his name<br>
Hosanna, Ho., Ho. to the Son of David!<br>
<br>
# H.33<span> HIS WERE THE WOUNDS<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**His were the wounds that healed us, (3)**<br>
**Behold the Lamb of God.**<br>

He did no wrong, he told no lie,<br>
He was silent under the rod;<br>
They cursed him and he kept his peace,<br>
He put his trust in his God.<br>

His body bore the weight of sin<br>
As he hung and died on the cross:<br>
That we, like him, should die to sin,<br>
And live as he did for God.<br>

He suffered so that we should walk<br>
On the very road that he trod;<br>
All we like sheep had gone astray,<br>
Till he led us back to God.<br>
<br>
# H.35<span> THE SIGN OF CONQUEST<br>

To the cross Jesus was pinioned,<br>
Helplessly for all to see,<br>
Our sins were nailed there beside our Saviour,<br>
He took them from us to set us free.<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**A sign of suffering, a sign of failure,**<br>
**A sign of foolishness, a sign of hate,**<br>
**A sign of victory, a sign of triumph,**<br>
**A sign of freedom and a sign of love.**<br>

From the cross the blood of Jesus<br>
Flowed out into the world,<br>
And with his dying breath He gave His spirit<br>
To guide and strengthen us on our way.<br>

Through the cross our Saviour gave us<br>
An example for our lives,<br>
That we might give ourselves for one another,<br>
If we can share in His sacrifice.<br>

Through the cross, Christ came to glory,<br>
Raised on high for all to see,<br>
The Father gave him new life and power,<br>
And we can share in His victory.<br>

...A sign of glory, a sign of majesty,<br>
Sign of the conquest of the Son of God.
