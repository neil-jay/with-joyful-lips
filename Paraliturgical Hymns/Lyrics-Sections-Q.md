Q.10
The world stands in need of liberation my Lord
It still has to feel your power
The blind and the deaf, the dumb and the maimed
All need to feel your healing touch
The world stands in need of liberation my Lord
It still has to learn to love

There are those who have eyes but refuse to see 
the inhumanity thatâ€™s done
There are those who have ears but refuse to hear
the cries of those in agony

There are those who have mouths but refuse to speak
against injustice done to some
There are those who have hands but refuse to reach
them out in love and charity

There are those who have talents they do not
use to build a true community
And we know that we all have the talent to love
but leave it buried in ourselves

Q.11
Ask and you will receive, seek and you will find
Knock and the door will be opened
For the love of the Lord has no end

Is there any one here, when his son asks for bread
Would turn him away with a stone instead?
Is there any one here when his child asks for meat
Would then give him a poisonous snake to eat?

So then how could your Father in heaven above
Who knows so much more of the ways of love
So then how could your Father refuse what is good
When you ask in the name of the Son he loves?

So whatever you ask you will always receive
Whatever you seek you will always find
For my Father will give to all those who believe
In the Spirit of love that will never end.
