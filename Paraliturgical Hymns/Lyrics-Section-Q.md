Q.10<br>
The world stands in need of liberation my Lord<br>
It still has to feel your power<br>
The blind and the deaf, the dumb and the maimed<br>
All need to feel your healing touch<br>
The world stands in need of liberation my Lord<br>
It still has to learn to love<br>

There are those who have eyes but refuse to see<br> 
the inhumanity thatâ€™s done<br>
There are those who have ears but refuse to hear<br>
the cries of those in agony<br>

There are those who have mouths but refuse to speak<br>
against injustice done to some<br>
There are those who have hands but refuse to reach<br>
them out in love and charity<br>

There are those who have talents they do not<br>
use to build a true community<br>
And we know that we all have the talent to love<br>
but leave it buried in ourselves<br>
<br>
Q.11<br>
Ask and you will receive, seek and you will find<br>
Knock and the door will be opened<br>
For the love of the Lord has no end<br>

Is there any one here, when his son asks for bread<br>
Would turn him away with a stone instead?<br>
Is there any one here when his child asks for meat<br>
Would then give him a poisonous snake to eat?<br>

So then how could your Father in heaven above<br>
Who knows so much more of the ways of love<br>
So then how could your Father refuse what is good<br>
When you ask in the name of the Son he loves?<br>

So whatever you ask you will always receive<br>
Whatever you seek you will always find<br>
For my Father will give to all those who believe<br>
In the Spirit of love that will never end.
