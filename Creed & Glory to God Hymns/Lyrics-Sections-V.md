V.39    
Glory we sing to God on high
Peace on earth to all his friends
We thank, we praise, we worship him
Lord God, our King and Father

His only Son, Lord Jesus Christ
Lord of all, the Lamb of God
Who saves the world from all its sin
To Him we  pray for mercy

Glory to you, the Holy one
Glory to you, the only Lord
To God be glory, Christ most high
The Spirit and the Father

V.68	
Glory,  glory, glory to God in the highest
And peace to his people on earth

Our Lord and God and King of the heavens
Mighty God and Father
We worship and give thanks to you
We praise you for your glory

Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father
Lamb of God, have mercy
You free the world from sinfulness
Have mercy, Lord have mercy

Receive our prayer, O Son of the Father
Hear our cry for mercy
As from your seat at his right hand
You share the throne of glory

For you are Lord, the One and the holy
With the Holy Spirit
You are the only Lord most high
In glory with the Father
