P.2<br>
Who will make his home in thy abode, O Lord?<br>
Who will rest secure upon thy mountain on high?<br>
One who walks blamelessly and does what is right,<br>
Who acts with justice and speaks the truth from his heart.<br>
<br>
Ant.:<br> 
In thy home thou wilt welcome him.<br>

One who does not slander with the tongue,<br>
Who does no evil to a friend.<br>

One who casts no slur on a neighbour,<br>
Who ever keeps a pledge, come what may.<br>

One who holds the godless in disdain,<br>
Who honours those who fear the Lord.<br>

One who sings the glory of the Triune God,<br>
Now, as for ever, in eternity.<br>
<br>
P.3<br>
Ref.:<br>
This is my prayer to thee, my Lord:<br>
Strike, strike at the root of penury in my heart.<br>

Give me the strength lightly to bear my joys<br>
and sorrows.<br>

Give me the strength to make my love fruitful<br>
in service.<br>

Give me the strength never to disown the poor<br>
or bend my knees before insolent might.<br>

Give me the strength to raise my mind high<br>
above daily trifles.<br>

Give me the strength to surrender my strength<br>
to thy will with love.<br>
<br>
P.4<br>
Ref.:<br>
Let thy love play upon my voice<br>
and rest on my silence.<br>

Let it pass through my heart into all my movements.<br>

Let thy love like stars shine in the darkness of my sleep<br>
And dawn in my awakening.<br>

Let it burn in the flame of my desires<br>
And flow in all currents of my own love.<br>

Let me carry thy love in my life as a harp does its music<br>
And give it back to thee at last with my life.<br>
<br>
P.5<br>
Ref.:<br>
I have come to thee to take thy touch<br>
before I begin my day.<br>

Let thy eye rest upon my eyes for a while.<br>

Let me take to my work the assurance of thy<br>
comradeship, my friend.<br>

Fill my mind with thy music to last through the<br>
desert of noise.<br>

Let thy love's sunshine kiss the peaks of my thoughts<br>
And linger in my life's valley where the harvest ripens.<br>
<br>
P.11<br>
Ant.:<br>
O let my humble prayer arise,<br>
Like fragrant incense in your sight,<br>
As an evening sacrifice to you. Lord.<br>

To you I have called, Lord, hasten to my help<br>
Give heed to my appeal, when I cry to you.<br>

Set a seal, O Lord, on my lips, on my words.<br>
Do not incline my heart to evil.<br>

To the Father and Son and Spirit<br>
Glory be for ever and ever. Amen.<br>
<br>
P.18<br>
Ref.:<br>
Day is done but love remains,<br>
Shadows fall but steadfast hope prevails.<br>
Loving Father, calm our fear,<br>
Watch our sleep, be ever near.<br>

Though the darkness now descends<br>
Yet your light shines through our night.<br>
You are ever with us, Lord,<br>
Guiding us with strength and might.<br>

When with sleep our eyes we close,<br>
You will watch us by our side,<br>
If we die, in sweet repose,<br>
Safe in love we still abide.<br>

Jesus, pardon all our sins,<br>
Is our prayer this eventide.<br>
Day is spent, the night begins,<br>
Therefore, Lord, with us abide.<br>
<br>
P.23<br>
Though the fig tree does not blossom<br>
And there be no fruit on the vines,<br>
The produce of the olive fails<br>
And the fields yield no food,<br>
Though the flock be cut off from the fold<br>
And there be no herd in the stalls,<br>

Yet will I rejoice in the Lord, (2)<br>
I will joy in the God of my salvation,<br>
God the Lord is my strength.<br>

Though the way be long and dreary<br>
And there be no sight of the end,<br>
My energr seems spent in vain<br>
And my strength almost fails,<br>
Even though dark shadows blur my view<br>
And I struggle hard to proceed...
