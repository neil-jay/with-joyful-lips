S.9	
Let all proclaim to the glory of the Father
That Jesus Lord, that Jesus is Lord
Let all proclaim to the glory of the Father
That Jesus Christ is Lord

Go to all the people, proclaim my name to all
Make disciples everywhere, baptise them in my name
Teach them to observe the things I’ve taught to you along
Know that I am with you always until the end of time

S.12
Follow me, follow me, leave your home and family
Leave your fishing nets and boats upon the shore
Leave the seed that you have sown
Leave the crops that you have grown
Leave the people you have known and follow me

The foxes have their holes
And the swallows have their nests
But the Son of man has no place to lie down
I do not offer comfort
I do not offer wealth
But in me will all happiness be found

If you would follow me
You must leave old ways behind
You must take my cross and follow on my path
You may be far from loved ones
You may be far from home
But my Father will welcome you at last

Although I go away
You will never be alone
For the Spirit will be there to comfort you
Though all of you may scatter
Each follow his own path
Still the spirit of love will lead you home
	
S.13
Leave your country and your people
Leave your family and your friends
Travel to the land I’ll show you
God will bless the ones He sends

Go like Abraham before you
When he heard the Father’s call
Walking froth in faith and trusting
God is master of us all

Sometimes God’s word is demanding
Leave security you know
Breaking ties and bonds that hold you
When the voice of God says: “Go”

Take the path into the desert
Barren seems the rock and sand
God will lead you through the desert
When you follow his command

Go with courage upon the mountain
Climb the narrow, rocky ledge
Leave behind all the things that hinder
Go with only God as pledge

S.16
You are a chosen generation
A royal priesthood, a holy nation
A dedicated people
That should show forth the praises of him
Who has called you out of darkness (3)
Into his marvellous light (2)
So come and sing Halleluiah, praise to the Lord
Come on and sing Halleluiah
And show forth the praises of Him
For he has called you out of darkness (3)
Into his marvellous light (2) (For....)
Into freedom (4) into his marvellous light (2)	

S.19
God’s Spirit is in my heart

God’s Spirit is in my heart
He has called me and se t me apart
This is what I have to do
What I have to do
He sent me to give the Good News to the poor
Tell prisoners that they are prisoners no more
Tell blind people that they can see
And set the downtrodden free
And go tell every one
The news that the Kingdom of God has done
And go tell every one
The news that God’s Kingdom has come

Just as the Father sent me
So I’m sending you out to be
My witnesses throughout the world
The whole of the world

Don’t carry a load in your pack
You don’t need two shirts on your back
A workman can earn his own keep
Can earn his own keep
