# DD.1<span> THIS IS MY COMMANDMENT<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**This is my commandment:**<br>
**Love one another as I have loved you. (2)**<br>

Charity is kind, feels no envy,<br>
Charity bears up to the end.<br>
Charity is meek, seeking not its own.<br>
Charity has faith to the end.<br>

Charity is mild, thinks no evil,<br>
Charity can hope to the end.<br>
Charity is just, finding joy in truth,<br>
Charity is patient to the end.<br>

Charity is never conceited.<br>
Charity brings joy to the end.<br>
Charity is never resentful.<br>
Charity makes peace to the end.<br>

I may speak in tongues, be a prophet<br>
Understand every mystery.<br>
Even though my faith may move mountains<br>
With no love, I’m nothing at all.<br>

I may give away my possessions,<br>
Even give my body to be burnt,<br>
If I have no love, I’m no better.<br>
For of all the greatest is love.<br>
<br>
# DD.2<span> WE HAVE KNOWN GOD'S LOVE<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**We have known God's love for us,**<br>
**Alleluia, alleluia.**<br>
**We too must lay down our lives**<br>
**for our brethren, alleluia, alleluia.**<br>

This is the message from Christ the Lord:<br>
God is light, in Him, there is no darkness.<br>
Have we attained the knowledge of God?<br>
The test is to keep his commandments.<br>

Yes, the unloving just don't know God;<br>
God is love, this love he showed to us,<br>
In that he sent his Son to the world<br>
To heal and forgive all our sins.<br>

The one who loves abides in light.<br>
One who hates one's neighbour, is in darkness,<br>
So let us love each other, my friends,<br>
For one who loves is of God.<br>

Let not our love be just talk or words.<br>
If it's true, it shows itself in action.<br>
By this we gain the knowledge of love:<br>
"That Christ laid his life down for us."<br>
<br>
# D.3<span> PRAYER FOR UNITY<br>
### ***Chorus-1:***<br>
**Gracious Lord, deign to gather in your Kingdom**<br>
**All the peoples who fill the universe.**<br>
### ***Chorus-2:***<br>
**Save us Lord, gather us from all the nations**<br>
**To give glory unto your holy name.**<br>

As grains of wheat in the host<br>
Form the Bread of Life,<br>
And as the grapes are pressed<br>
To make the precious Wine,<br>
Help us to keep this unity<br>
In the bond of peace and charity.<br>

O God of Love, shed your light<br>
Over all the earth,<br>
Give us the strength to spread<br>
Fraternal love and zeal,<br>
To kindle all humanity<br>
With the mighty flame of charity.<br>

Companions all, from the towns,<br>
From the countryside,<br>
From every plain and field,<br>
From vale and mountain height,<br>
Come 'neath the shadow of the cross,<br>
One in faith and trust, in Jesus Christ.<br>
<br>
# DD.4<span> O LORD, FURNACE OF LOVE<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**O Lord, furnace of love,**<br>
**Set our hearts on fire with charity.**<br>

Where there is hatred, let's sow his love.<br>
Where there is injury, let us show pardon.<br>
Where there is strife, let us bring his peace.<br>
Where there is error, truth.<br>

Where there is doubt, let's kindle faith.<br>
Where there's discouragement,<br>
Let's bring assurance.<br>
Where there is sadness, let's awaken joy.<br>
Where there is darkness, light.<br>
<br>
# D.6<span> I'VE RECEIVED THE LIVING BREAD<br>
### ***Chorus-1:***<br>
**I’ve received the living Bread and my heart is filled with joy. (2)**<br>
### ***Chorus-2:***<br>
**Every one who lives in me shall obtain eternal life. (2)**<br>

He says to me: I am the Bread<br>
Which I give to feed your soul:<br>
He who eats of this my flesh,<br>
Will attain the heav’nly goal.<br>

He says to me: I am the Vine<br>
Which will nourish every shoot;<br>
As it feeds upon my sap,<br>
It will give abundant fruit.<br>

He says to me: I am the Life<br>
Which destroys eternal doom;<br>
Whosoever lives in me,<br>
Will rise like me from the tomb.<br>

He says to me: I am the Way<br>
Where my Father waits for you;<br>
If you follow in my steps,<br>
You will see me with him too.<br>

He says to me: I am the Light<br>
In the darkness of your night;<br>
Whosoever welcomes me,<br>
Will be led on paths aright.<br>
<br>
# D.9<span> I AM THE GOOD SHEPHERD<br>
### ***Chorus-1:***<br>
**O how good and delightful to live**<br>
**together all united.**<br>
### ***Chorus-2:***<br>
**Greater love has no one than this that he**<br>
**lay down his life for those he loves.**<br>

I am the Good Shepherd, says the Lord,<br>
My life I lay down for my sheep,<br>
I know my own and my own know me,<br>
As the Father knows me and I know him.<br>

If you keep on faithful to my word,<br>
You are truly my disciples,<br>
You shall come to know the truth indeed,<br>
And the truth shall make you free.<br>

I am the vine and you are the branches,<br>
And my Father is the gardener,<br>
Those who dwell in me, bear abundant fruit,<br>
For without me you can do nothing.<br>

Those who come to me shall not hunger,<br>
Who believe in me shall never thirst,<br>
I am the Bread that came down from heaven,<br>
Bread that brings life to the world.<br>

Greater love has no one than this,<br>
That he lay down his life for others.<br>
Therefore love each other as I loved you:<br>
This is my commandment to you.<br>

No longer do I call you servants,<br>
Rather have I called you my friends,<br>
All the things I heard from my Father,<br>
I have made known unto you.<br>
<br>
# D.10<span> THERE WILL BE ONE SHEPHERD<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**There will be one shepherd, all the sheep**<br>
**will hear his voice, they will form**<br>
one only fold.**<br>

Glorify the Lord with me,<br>
Together let us praise his name.<br>
The Lord turns his eyes to the just,<br>
His ears are attentive to their cries.<br>

The Lord restored Jerusalem,<br>
He brought back Israel's exiles.<br>
He healed their broken hearts,<br>
He bound up all their wounds.<br>

The Lord is compassion and love,<br>
Slow to anger and rich in mercy.<br>
He does not treat us according to our sins,<br>
Nor repay us according to our faults.<br>

He has sent deliverance to his people<br>
And established his covenant for ever;<br>
His designs shall stand for ever,<br>
The plans of his heart from age to age.<br>

The Lord is good and upright<br>
He shows the path to those who stray.<br>
He guides the humble in the right path,<br>
He teaches his way to the poor.<br>

How good and how pleasant it is<br>
For people to dwell in unity!<br>
Praise the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit,<br>
Both now and for ever. Amen.<br>
<br>
# D.11<span> WHERE LOVE AND CHARITY<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Where love and charity are found,**<br>
**God there abides.**<br>

The love of Christ has gathered us together,<br>
Let us rejoice to be united in the Lord,<br>
Let us revere, let us love the living God.<br>
With hearts sincere, let us love one another.<br>

And since we live in unity together,<br>
Let us take heed that we be not divided,<br>
Let our disputes, our quarrels and<br>
contentions cease.<br>
And so let Jesus, our Lord, in our midst abide.<br>

And let us also with your Saints,<br>
O Christ our Lord,<br>
Behold your face in the glory of heav'n<br>
Where you, yourself will be<br>
our happiness and joy,<br>
Forever more through all ages to come. Amen.<br>
<br>
# D.13<span> WITH YOU AS MY GUIDE / Psalm 22<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**With you as my guide, I’ll not want:**<br>
**You are my Shepherd, Lord, nothing shall I fear.**<br>

In pastures fresh and green,<br>
You give my soul response;<br>
Near cool and restful waters,<br>
My spirit you revive.<br>

In vales of gloom and death,<br>
No evil shall I dread,<br>
Your strength and peaceful presence<br>
Will be my comfort sure.<br>

A banquet you have spread,<br>
While foes in envy watch.<br>
My head you have anointed,<br>
My cup now overflows.<br>

Your loving favour, Lord,<br>
Shall surely follow me<br>
Until one day in heaven,<br>
For ever shall I dwell.<br>
<br>
# D.15<span>MY SOUL IS LONGING / Psalm 130<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**My Soul is longing for your peace,**<br>
**near to you, my God.**<br>

Lord, you know that my heart is not proud,<br>
And my eyes are not lifted from the earth.<br>

Lofty thoughts have never filled my mind,<br>
Far beyond my sight all ambitious deeds.<br>

In your peace I have maintained my soul,<br>
I have kept my heart in your quiet peace.<br>

As a child rests on his mother's knee,<br>
So I place my soul in your loving care.<br>

Israel, put all your hope in God,<br>
Place your trust in him, now and evermore.<br>
<br>
# D.18<span> SING MY SOUL<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Sing my soul at the joy that I feel;**<br>
**There is now, dwelling in me, my God.**<br>

It is through you, Lord, that I act,<br>
Ev’ry prayer, ev’ry thought of mine,<br>
Comes from you, Lord divine.<br>

Lord, it is your wish, that I may,<br>
By my life, show people around<br>
How to love, more and more.<br>

It is to you, Lord, that I turn<br>
When in need and my heart is grieved;<br>
For your love brings me joy.<br>

Lord, it is your wish that my life<br>
In this world brings abundant fruit<br>
For the kingdom of heaven.<br>

<br>
# D.23<span> THIS IS MY WILL, MY ONE COMMAND<br>
This is my will, my one command,<br>
That love should dwell among you all.<br>
This is my will that you should love<br>
As I have shown that I love you.<br>

No greater love a man can have<br>
Than that he die to save his friends.<br>
You are my friends if you obey<br>
What I command that you should do.<br>

I call you now no longer slaves;<br>
No slave knows all his master does.<br>
I call you friends for all I hear<br>
My Father say, you hear from me.<br>

You chose not me, but I chose you,<br>
That you should go and bear much fruit.<br>
I chose you out that you in me<br>
Should bear much fruit that will abide.<br>

All that you ask my Father dear<br>
For my name’s sake you shall receive,<br>
This is my will, my one command,<br>
That love should dwell in each, in all.<br>

### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Come and eat of my bread,**<br>
**and drink of my wine:**<br>
**Come to the feast I prepared for you.**<br>

They have come from the eastern and western lands,<br>
Gathered around your table<br>
At the feast of the kingdom.<br>

Bread of heav'n is the food that is offered here,<br>
Bread soon to be your Body,<br>
(Bread now become your Body)<br>
Which is cause for eternal life.<br>

Living Bread that the Father has giv'n to us,<br>
Food for our Paschal feasting,<br>
Sign of promise renewed once more.<br>

Cup of wine poured to cheer<br>
Every toubled heart,<br>
Free us from every sadness,<br>
Blood of Christ, our redeeming wine.<br>

By your love, we are drawn into unity,<br>
Singing our joyous praises,<br>
While rememb'ring your tender care.<br>
<br>
# D.26<span> THEY'LL KNOW WE ARE CHRISTIANS<br>

We are one in the Spirit, we are one in the Lord,<br>
And we pray that all unity may one day be restored.<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**And they'll know we are Christians**<br>
**by our love, by our love,**<br>
**Yes, they'll know we are Christians**<br>
**by our love.**<br>

We will walk with each other,<br>
we will walk hand in hand. (2)<br>
And together we'll spread the news<br>
that God is in our land.<br>

We will work with each other,<br>
We will work side by side (2)<br>
And we'll guard each one's dignity<br>
and save each one's pride.<br>

All praise to the Father<br>
from whom all things come.<br>
And all praise to Christ Jesus, His only Son,<br>
And all praise to the Spirit, who makes us one.<br>

# D.27<span> WHATSOEVER YOU DO<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Whatsoever you do to the least of my people,**<br>
**that you do unto me.**<br>

When I was hungry, you gave me to eat;<br>	
When I was thirsty, you gave me to drink.<br>
Now enter into the home of my Father.<br>

When I was weary, you helped me find rest;<br>
When I was anxious, you calmed all my fears.<br>

When I was homeless, you opened your door,<br>
When I was naked, you gave me your coat.<br>

When I was little, you taught me to read;<br>
When I was lonely, you gave me your love.<br>

When in a prison, you came to my cell;<br>
When on a sick bed, you cared for my needs.<br>

In a strange country, you made me at home;<br>
Seeking employment, you found me a job.<br>

When I was laughed at, you stood by my side;<br>
When I was happy, you shared in my joy.<br>
<br>
# D.29<span> JESUS ALWAYS LOVED HIS OWN<br>

Jesus always loved his own<br>
and he showed it to the full;<br>
When at supper from the table,<br>
He got up and took a towel.<br>
Then he wrapped it round His waist,<br>
in a basin water poured.<br>
Then began to wash the feet of all his friends.<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Know, my people, what I’ve done to you:**<br>
**Lord you call me, It is what I am.**<br>
**If then I, your Lord, deigned to wash your feet,**<br>
**You should do the same and wash each other’s feet.**<br>

Jesus always loved his own<br>
and he showed it to the full;<br>
When He came to Simon Peter,<br>
the apostle said to him:<br>
“Never shall you wash my feet.”<br>
Then the Lord replied to him:<br>
“It is not for you to know what now I do.”<br>

Jesus always loved his own<br>
and he showed it to the full;<br>
When He said to Simon Peter:<br>
“If I do not wash your feet,<br>
You can have no part with me.”<br>
Then said Peter to his Lord:<br>
“Wash my hands, my head and not my feet alone.”<br>

Jesus always loved his own<br>
and he showed it to the full;<br>
He has set us an example<br>
that we do as He has done.<br>
Can a servant greater be<br>
than his master Christ, the Lord?<br>
If we know and do this,<br>
happy we shall be.<br>
<br>
# DD.36<span> CHRIST'S LOVE FOR US<br>

Love is his word, love is his way,<br>
Feasting with all, fasting alone,<br>
Living and dying, rising again,<br>
Love, only love his way.<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Richer than gold is the love of my Lord;**<br>
**Better than splendour and wealth. (2)**<br>

Love is his way, love is his mark,<br>
Sharing his last Passover feast,<br>
Christ at his table, host to the twelve,<br>
Love, only love is his mark.<br>

Love is his mark, love is his sign,<br>
Bread of our strength, wine for our joy:<br>
“This is my body, This is my blood”,<br>
Love, only love, is his sign.<br>

Love is his name, love is his law,<br>
Hear his command, all who are his:<br>
“Love one another, as I have loved you.”<br>
Love, only love is his law.<br>
<br>
# D.37<span> TAKE, EAT<br>

**Take, drink of this cup,**<br>
**Poured for you and for many.**<br>
**Do this in remembrance of me.**<br>

I am the living bread,<br>
come down from heaven.<br>
Anyone who eats this bread,<br>
will live for ever.<br>

He who eats of this, my flesh,<br>
and drinks my saving blood,<br>
Shall abide in me,<br>
and I abide in him.<br>

For my flesh is food indeed,<br>
my blood is really drink.<br>
Those who eat and drink,<br>
will have eternal life.<br>
<br>
# D.38<span> LORD, I ADORE YOU<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Lord, I adore you, who dwells in my heart**<br>
**And my soul overflows with joy.**<br>
**Your presence, O Lord, is my greatest delight;**<br>
**What shall I fear if in me you abide?**<br>

It is not I who live:<br>
It is Christ who lives in me.<br>
If I stay always faithful to his love,<br>
If I keep in my heart his commandments.<br>

I give you thanks, O God,<br>
For the body of the Lord<br>
That your people together shares in joy.<br>
May it help us to love one another.<br>

I give you thanks, O Lord,<br>
For the gifts on me bestowed,<br>
For the peace, for the hope and for the help<br>
That you offer to all those who seek you.<br>

Let us rejoice in Christ,<br>
Alleluia, evermore.<br>
To the end of our life we shall proclaim<br>
All the blessings of God to his people.<br>
<br>
# D.40<span> GONE ARE THE SHADOWS<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Gone are the shadows,**<br>
**dazzling light now instead.**<br>
**It's you Lord, you've returned.**<br>
**Welcome indeed the gentle hush of your voice.**<br>
**It's you, Lord, you've returned.**<br>

You see our hearts of stone,<br>
you see our cruel hands,<br>
Building your cross, you are there!<br>
You turn our hearts to flesh,<br>
you make our hands relax,<br>
You take us by the hand.<br>

You see our bodies still,<br>
you see us passing by,<br>
Still you await, you are there.<br>
And you forget our wars,<br>
and you forget our dead,<br>
You take us by the hand.<br>

Why should we shed our tears,<br>
why to be filled with fear?<br>
Why to complain, you are there.<br>
Our eyes begin to see,<br>
through you our fears subside,<br>
You take us by the hand.<br>

After our night comes light,<br>
after our strife comes love.<br>
After our death you are there.<br>
We had been made for you,<br>
we shall relive in you.<br>
You take us by the hand.<br>
<br>
# D.43<span> THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD<br>

The Lord is my shepherd,<br>
There is nothing I shall want.<br>
Fresh and green are the pastures<br>
Where he gives me repose,<br>
Near restful waters he leads me<br>
To revive my drooping spirit.<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**The Lord is my shepherd,**<br>
**There is nothing I shall want.**<br>
**Yes, the Lord is my shepherd,**<br>
**There is nothing I shall want.**<br>

He guides me along<br>
What he knows to be right.<br>
If I walk in the darkness<br>
No evil would I fear.<br>
I know that he will be there<br>
With his crook and with his staff.<br>

The Lord has prepared<br>
Such a banquet for me.<br>
Surely goodness and kindness<br>
Shall follow after me.<br>
In the Lord’s own house shall I dwell<br>
All the days of my life.<br>
<br>
# D.44<span> NO ONE CAN GIVE<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**No one can give to me**<br> 
**That peace which my risen Lord,**<br>
**My risen King can give. (2)**<br>

When I look around and see<br>
All the things that trouble me<br>
And I seem to lose my peace<br>
In a world that’s not at ease.<br>

Says my risen Christ to me:<br>
My true peace I give to thee,<br>
But not as the world doth give<br>
Is my peace that makes one live.<br>

His true peace in me will stay<br>
As I live from day to day,<br>
And his joy will never end<br>
And in heaven it will extend.<br>

Christ has risen from the dead,<br>
Triumphed over sin and death,<br>
And he’ll never die again<br>
But as Lord he’ll live and reign.<br>
<br>
# D.45<span> COME, O LORD, TO MY HEART<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Come, O Lord, to my heart today**<br>
**And stay with me all the day. (2)**<br>

Your flesh is food and your blood is drink<br>
With these you give to me your life.<br>

This is the bread come down from heaven<br>
Which, if we eat, we'll live for ever.<br>

If we take your flesh and blood,<br>
We will live in you and you in us.<br>

When you give yourself to us,<br>
You bind us to yourself and each other.<br>
<br>
# D.46<span> TAKE THIS, ALL OF YOU<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Take this, all of you, eat of this my flesh.**<br>
**Take, this is my blood, shed for sinners all.**<br>
**For my life I give and my love I share:**<br>
**Trust and believe in me.**<br>

Truly I say, my brethren:<br>
Should you not drink my blood,<br>
Should you not eat my body,<br>
You have no life in you.<br>

Work for the food that’s lasting,<br>
Work not for food that spoils,<br>
Work for the bread from heaven,<br>
And gain eternal life.<br>

I am the resurrection,<br>
I am the bread of life.<br>
One who has faith enduring,<br>
Will live for ever.<br>
<br>
# D.49<span> O LORD, I'M NOT WORTHY<br>

**O Lord, I’m not worthy,**<br>
**Yet you come to live in me.**<br>
**So speak your word of comfort,**<br>
**By your touch strengthen and heal me.**<br>

Take this and eat my body.<br>
And drink my saving blood,<br>
Poured out for your redemption:<br>
A symbol of my love.<br>

Called to be God’s new people,<br>
Made one in Christ the Lord,<br>
Let us with hearts united<br>
Bear witness of your love.<br>

Onward through life we journey,<br>
As seekers of the truth,<br>
Building each day a new world<br>
Of justice, peace and love.<br>
<br>
# D.50<span> ALL YOU WHO HUNGER<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**All you who hunger and thirst for the Lord,**<br>
**Come to his banquet to-day,**<br>
**Jesus our Saviour is calling:**<br>
**All you who pass by the way,**<br>
**Come to the feast that is ready,**<br>
**Hasten and do not delay.**<br>

We are but pilgrims unworthy, O Christ,<br>
Say but the word that will heal,<br>
That we may taste of your goodness,<br>
Share in your heavenly meal,<br>
Till you in heaven your beauty,<br>
To us enraptured, reveal.<br>

Bread for the journey that takes us, dear Lord,<br>
Nearer your kingdom each day,<br>
Wine for the weakness that breaks us,<br>
Slaking our thirst on the way<br>
Till we shall meet where forever<br>
Love is the sceptre and sway.<br>
<br>
# D.51<span> MAKE ME A CHANNEL OF PEACE<br>

Make me a channel of your peace,<br>
Where there is hatred, let me bring your love,<br>
Where there is injury, your pardon, Lord,<br>
And where there’s doubt, true faith in you.<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Oh Master, grant that I may never seek**<br>
**So much to be consoled as to console,**<br>
**To be understood as to understand,**<br>
**To be loved as to love with all my soul.**<br>

Make me a channel of your peace,<br>
Where there’s despair in life, let bring hope,<br>
Where there is darkness, only light.<br>
And where there’s sadness, ever joy.<br>

Make me a channel of your peace.<br>
It is in pardoning that we are pardoned.<br>
In giving to each one that we receive,<br>
And in dying that we’re born to eternal life.<br>
<br>
# D.52<span> COME INTO THIS HEART OF STONE<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Come, Jesus, come into this heart of stone.**<br>
**Come, Jesus, come into this heart of stone.**<br>
**Melt and mould it and make it your own.**<br>
**Come, Jesus, come into this heart of stone.**<br>
	
I’m not ashamed to tell you, Lord,<br>
That I’m a sinner man.<br>
I just love to do the things<br>
That go against your plan.<br>

Love your neighbour as yourself<br>
Is what you command,<br>
But his sufferings, tears and pain<br>
Is something I can’t stand.<br>

When my neighbour’s hungry<br>
And naked in the street,<br>
I just cannot bear to see<br>
And from him I retreat.<br>

You want me to be the salt<br>
And leaven in the dough,<br>
But I prefer to stand aloof<br>
And let the world just go.<br>

I want to change myself,<br>
I don’t wanna be a stone,<br>
I need your Spirit, Lord,<br>
'Cause I cant do it alone.<br>

# D.53<span> COME UNTO ME<br>

For my yoke is easy<br>

unless the Father draw him.<br>

**And I will raise him up (3)**<br>
**...on the last day.**<br>

The bread that I will give<br>
Is my flesh for the life of the world.<br>
The one who eats of this bread,<br>
Shall live for ever. (2)<br>

Unless you eat of the flesh of the Son of Man,<br>
And drink of his blood (2)<br>
You shall not have life within you.<br>

I am the resurrection, I am the life;<br>

The Son of God who has come into the world.<br>

# D.61<span> I MAY SPEAK<br>

I may speak in the tongues of angels<br>
And foretell with a heavenly song.<br>
Should it be that my love is lacking,<br>
Then my voice is a sounding gong.<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Three things last for ever: faith, hope, and love.**<br>
**And the greatest of these is love. (2)**<br>

I may give all I have to neighbours,<br>
And explore every mansion above<br>
To possess all the jewels of wisdom:<br>
I am nothing at all without love.<br>

By my faith I may move the mountains<br>
And may stand for a cause to be won.<br>
If I do not have love in doing,<br>
Then I shall be the better by none.<br>

Now this loving is kind and generous<br>
And a wonderful, glorious sign<br>
Of the limitless, deep compassion<br>
From the Power supremely divine.<br>

**Come, O Lord, and show the path**<br>
**To eternity.**<br>

In this world of doubt and darkness,<br>
Cruel deeds and lack of kindness,<br>

When my cross is hard to carry,<br>
Give me hope, my faith increase.<br>

I am weak and often stumble,<br>
But I know you love the humble.<br>
Help me walk in trust again.<br>
Yes, Lord, be my friend.<br>

No one can have a greater love<br>
Than to give one's life for one's friends.<br>

My peace I give to all who live<br>
With sincere love for all mankind.<br>

I am the vine<br>

And I will raise you up on the last day.<br>

To be the hope for all mankind.<br>

Take his gift and be at peace;<br>

By this love which you should have<br>
People will know you are my friends.<br>

Take my words of life to heart,<br>
And you will live with hope and joy.<br>

All I have I give to you:<br>
I share with you the Father's love.<br>

And have it to the full.<br>

If you love me keep my word,<br>
And our home we'll make with you.<br>

### ***Chorus:***<br>

**A feast to lift us up!**<br>

**As food and saving cup.**<br>

The door is open, enter in<br>
And take your place by right.<br>
For you've been chosen as his guest<br>
To share his love and light.<br>

We come together as the twelve<br>
Came to the Upper Room.<br>
Our host is Jesus Christ the Lord,<br>
Now risen from the tomb.<br>

Who travels needs both food and drink<br>
To help him on his way.<br>
Refreshed and strong we'll journey on<br>
And face another day.<br>

Who shares this meal, receives the Lord<br>
Who lives, though he was dead.<br>
So death can hold no terrors now<br>
For those who eat this bread.<br>
<br>
# D.80<span> MY PEACE I LEAVE WITH YOU<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>

**Peace that the world can't bring, I give to you.**<br>

You must abide in me and I in you,<br>
For if we live apart, you can't bear fruit.<br>

Let not your hearts be sad nor be afraid;<br>
The light is with you now, walk in the light.<br>

Now if a grain of wheat falls to the earth,<br>
It will spring up again and bear new life.<br>

And when the Spirit comes, he'll strengthen you;<br>
You'll be my witness through all the earth.<br>
<br>
# D.81<span> FEED ON ME<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>

Set your heart on food that long endures.<br>
I will feed the food you need,<br>
Take my words, my Father's life is yours.<br>

Moses brought you manna in the desert.<br>
Still you ask for signs from God on high.<br>
I'm the bread that God has fed,<br>
Believe in me, and you will never die.<br>

I will give my flesh as bread to feed you.<br>
I will give my blood as wine to share,<br>
Taste and know that love will grow,<br>
Dwell in me, you'll find my Father's care.<br>
<br>
# D.82<span> IT'S NO LONGER I THAT LIVE<br>

but Christ that lives in me.<br>
<br>
# D.84<span> MAY THE PEACE OF CHRIST<br>

# D.86<span> TAKE THIS AND EAT<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Take this and eat it, for this is my body.**<br>
**Take this and drink it, for this is my blood.**<br>

Taste and see that the Lord is all goodness.<br>
Happy those who take refuge in Him.<br>

Come to Me, you who are heavy laden;<br>
Take my yoke, for my burden is light.<br>

When you eat and you drink at this table,<br>
Jesus's death you proclaim till he comes.<br>

Eat, you poor, and be filled, you afflicted.<br>
Those who seek him, give praise to the Lord.<br>

Come, be filled as you sit at my table.<br>
Quench your thirst as you drink of my wine.<br>

You who eat, break your bread with the hungry.<br>
You who drink of his Spirit, give praise.<br>

Beautiful is the place of your dwelling;<br>
How my soul longs for you, O my God.<br>

See, how good and delightful that people<br>
Share this meal to bring unity.<br>
<br>
# D.87<span> HOW WONDERFUL, HOW GOOD<br>

How wonderful, how good to live in Jesus.<br>
To let his love now fill<br>
Our minds and hearts and will.<br>
To rise with Jesus.<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**So let this be our aim:**
**To make our lives proclaim**
**That God is love, that God is love.**

And since in unity we live together,<br>
Our quarrels now must cease<br>
And we must live at peace<br>
With Christ among us.<br>

This bread of life we share is Christ's own body.<br>
A sign that we must care<br>
For those who are in need<br>
The poor, the hungry.<br>
<br>
# D.88<span> LIKE A SHEPHERD<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Like a shepherd He feeds his flock**<br>
**And gathers the lambs in his arms,**<br>
**Holding them carefully close to his heart,**<br>
**Leading them home.**<br>

Say to the cities of Judah:<br>
Prepare the way of the Lord.<br>
Go to the mountain top, lift up your voice:<br>
"Jerusalem, here is your God".<br>

I, myself, will shepherd them,<br>
For others have led them astray.<br>
The lost, I will rescue and heal their wounds<br>
And pasture them, giving them rest.<br>

Come unto me<br>
If you are heavily burdened,<br>
And take my yoke upon your shoulders,<br>
I will give you rest.<br>
<br>
# D.89<span> TO BE THE BODY OF THE LORD<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**To be the body of the Lord in this world,**<br>
**To have his Spirit coursing through my soul,**<br>
**To know the passion of my Jesus in his love for every one,**<br>
**To show his mercy in the shadows of this land:**<br>

Come, walk with me, come, share my life.<br>
You must know the shadows,<br>
If you would know the light.<br>

No eyes have I, no ears to hear,<br>
You must be my body<br>
And show my Father’s care.<br>

I am the vine, branches are you.<br>
Life from me eternal<br>
To make your world anew.<br>

One bread, one cup; one heart and mind.<br>
One great human people<br>
In fellowship divine.<br>
<br>
# D.90<span> BREAD THAT WAS SOWN<br>

**Bread that was sown in our hills and valleys,**<br>
**Now harvested, becomes one;**<br>
**From all the world gather your people, O God,**<br>
**Into the feast of your love.**<br>

With grateful hearts, we sing our joy<br>
For knowing the Spirit within, among us all,<br>
Life and knowledge, revealed through your word:<br>
Jesus, the Christ, Emmanuel.<br>

Leaven and Wheat: so let us be for others,<br>
Nurturing good with earnest care,<br>
Bringing to birth new life where hope has gone stale,<br>
Faith-giving moments to share.<br>
<br>
# D.91<span> IT IS YOUR NAME<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**It is your name we bear in our hearts**<br>
**And we know it through Jesus' words of life.**<br>
**All the love you have given to Him:**<br>
**In this we share, in this we live.**<br>

May we all be one in God's own life<br>
And see his presence so longing to be known.<br>
And the path that we are free to choose,<br>
Will lead us on in search of what is real.<br>

True to his name, we hope to live for ever,<br>
Seeking peace that comes from deep within.<br>
When we search for meaning beyond words,<br>
We'll see a new day dawning in our world.<br>
<br>
# D.92<span> OH, HOW GOOD<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**O how good, how wonderful it is**<br>
**When brothers and sisters live as one. (2)**<br>

It is as fragrant as pure oil,<br>
The ointment of the Lord,<br>
Flowing down as on Aaron of old,<br>
Anointing every one.<br>

It is as refreshing as the dew<br>
Upon the mountain of the Lord,<br>
For there the favour of the Lord remains,<br>
The blessing of everlasting life.<br>
<br>
# D.93<span> BIND US TOGETHER<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Bind us together, Lord, Lord bind us together**<br>
**With cords, that cannot be broken.**<br>
**Bind us together, Lord (2)**<br>
**Bind us together with love.**<br>

There is only one God, there is only one King,<br>
There is only one Body, that is why I sing:<br>

Though there are many branches,<br>
There is only one vine,<br>
We are one in Christ Jesus, that is why...<br>

One with Christ in his death,<br>
That, as one, we might rise.<br>
So we are but one people, that is why...<br>

There is only one table,<br>
Christ alone is our host.<br>
He invites us together, that is why...<br>
<br>
# D.94<span> YOURS IS THE KINGDOM<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Yours is the Kingdom, Yours is the power**<br>
**Yours is the glory evermore!**<br>
**Lord, forever, Lord for evermore!**<br>

From the ends of all earth<br>
And out beyond the stars<br>
Gathered in your presence we are one.<br>

One in the bread we break<br>
And one in our concern,<br>
One with you we celebrate this day.<br>

Freedom is your gift for all<br>
Who live and die in you.<br>
Freedom is finding life in you.<br>

Broken bread is scattered on<br>
The hillsides and the plains.<br>
Broken hearts and bodies cry for rest.<br>
<br>
# D.95<span> A NEW COMMANDMENT<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**A new commandment I give unto you,**<br>
**That you love one another**<br>
**as I have loved you. (2)**<br>

By this shall all know<br>
That you are my disciples:<br>
If you have love for one another (2).<br>

You are my friends<br>
If you do what I command you.<br>
Without my help you can do nothing (2).<br>

I am the true Vine,<br>
My Father is the gardener.<br>
Abide in me and I in you (2).<br>

Now, love is patient,<br>
Not arrogant, nor boastful.<br>
Love bears all things, love is eternal (2).<br>
<br>
# D.96<span> GOD IS GOOD TO ME<br>

God is good to me! O what love I see!<br>
Jesus as a lamb was slain.<br>
He delivered me, cleansed and set me free;<br>
Lord of all, He rose again!<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Now I live, yet not I!**<br>
**Jesus is alive in me!**<br>
**Sending the Spirit’s flame into my heart again,**<br>
**God has poured his love on me!**<br>

God has shown his love, sent his only Son:<br>
Jesus Christ to save the world.<br>
Life eternal through his death He brought.<br>
Yes, believe that God is Love!<br>

Lives in God and God in him.<br>

'Cause I know He loved me first.<br>
<br>
# D.97<span> FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD<br>

You shall love the Lord your God<br>

You shall love the Lord your God<br>
with all your heart,<br>
You shall love your neighbour as yourself.<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**For God so loved the world.**<br>
**That He gave us his only Son.**<br>
**Whoever trusts in Him,**<br>
**Shall obtain eternal life. (2)**<br>

Tis by grace you have been saved<br>
through faith in Christ,<br>
Not by works, lest you boast.<br>
Even when your trespasses had rendered you dead,<br>
You were made alive in Jesus Christ.<br>

As the Lord has pardoned you,<br>
so must you forgive:<br>
Let his peace rule your heart,<br>
He has nailed your trespasses<br>
and sins to the cross.<br>
So give thanks to God through Jesus Christ.<br>

And I pray that Jesus Christ<br>
may dwell in your hearts,<br>
Through your faith, through your love.<br>
May his Spirit strengthen you<br>
with power and might.<br>
May your lives be rooted in love.<br>
<br>
# D.98<span> GREATER LOVE<br>

Greater love and friendship<br>
has no man than this<br>
That he die for others, give his life for all.<br>
No more are you servants,<br>
I have called you friends.<br>
All my Father told me, I made known to you.<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Without you I am nothing.**<br>
**My weakness needs your strength.**<br>
**So speak, Lord, to your servant.**<br>
**I'm waiting for your word!**<br>

Go and build my kingdom,<br>
pluck up and break down.<br>
Speak what I command you, I shall be with you.<br>
No, you did not choose me, I appointed you.<br>
Go, bear fruit in plenty, fruit that should abide.<br>

Have you seen my people,<br>
have you heard their cry?<br>
Do you know their suffering,<br>
can you let them die?<br>
Break the unjust fetter, set the captive free.<br>
Share bread with the hungry,<br>
make the blind to see.<br>
<br>
# D.99<span> MAKE ME AN INSTRUMENT<br>

Make me an instrument of your peace:<br>
Where there is hatred, let me bring love.<br>
Where there is injury, your pardon, Lord,<br>
and where there’s doubt, true faith in you.<br>

Where there’s discouragement, let me bring hope.<br>
Where there is darkness, let me bring your light,<br>
and where there’s sadness, let me bring joy.<br>

It is in pardoning that we are pardoned,<br>
It is in giving that we do receive,<br>
and it’s in dying that we’re born to life.<br>
<br>
# D.100<span> COME TO MY FATHER<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Come to my Father through me (2)**<br>
**I’m the way, the truth and the life,**<br>
**Come to my Father through me.**<br>

Do not let your hearts be troubled<br>
Over things you shouldn’t bother,<br>
Just trust in my Father and in me<br>
And all things will follow.<br>

Lord, we do not have an idea<br>
Where you are going.<br>
So how can we follow the way?<br>
Teach us, we pray you.<br>

Words that I have spoken,<br>
I do not speak on my own,<br>
But the Father who dwells in me,<br>
Does his works through me.<br>

I am the way, the truth,<br>
I am the Life.<br>
No one can come to the Father<br>
But only through me.<br>
<br>
# D.104<span> MAKE ME A SERVANT<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>

**Lord, let me lift up those who are weak,**<br>
**And may the prayer of heart always be:**<br>
**Make me a servant, make me a servant,**<br>
**Make me a servant to-day!**<br>

Even though you were in the form of God,<br>
You took the form of a slave.<br>
You accepted death even on a cross,<br>
So God exalted your name.<br>

Ere you formed me in my mother’s womb,<br>
You called me by my name.<br>
And you touched my mouth and appointed me<br>
A prophet to the world.<br>

May I heal the sick and the crippled bind,<br>
Bring back the sheep that stray,<br>
May I seek the lost and the weak make strong,<br>
With justice feed the poor.<br>
<br>
# D.105<span> MY HEART'S LIKE A FLUTE<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**My heart’s like a flute and I want to play all day.**<br>
**Jesus Christ is my music master.**<br>
**Deep from my heart flows a simple melody:**<br> 
**Great is his love, love without end! (2)**<br>

Once I met the Lord on the way:<br>
Deep was his gaze, kind was his smile,<br>
True were his words, gentle his touch.<br>
He brought me peace and freedom.<br>

He’s my shepherded, He’s my guide.<br>
Dark be the night, Christ is my light.<br>
Nothing I fear, Jesus is near:<br>
He leads me to the Kingdom.<br>

T’wards the land of promise we walk,<br>
There to find peace, there to find joy,<br>
There to find love: God has prepared<br>
A banquet for his people.<br>

The bread we break and we share with each other,<br>
The hearts that we give bring joy to the lonely...<br>

See, O Lord, the bread of our life,<br>
The bread of heaven which brightens our pathway,<br>
The bread of the way that leads to the kingdom...<br>

See, O Lord, the wine of our joy,<br>
The wine which flows from the grapes of our vineyards,<br>
The joy of the earth, the wine of our feasting...<br>

We who break this bread are one body.<br>
We who share this cup are all one.<br>
Children of our Father in heaven,<br>
We are heirs with God's only Son.<br>

Wheat and grape incarnate a mystery:<br>
Jesus is the true living bread.<br>
Let us eat with joy and thanksgiving.<br>
Trusting in the word he has said.<br>

Jesus is the vine, we the branches;<br>
We are grains of wheat, Christ the bread.<br>

# D.110<span> LIVE ON IN MY LOVE<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Live on, live on in my love (2)**<br>
**As the Father has loved me, so I love you.**<br>
**Live on, live on in my love.**<br>

You will live in my love<br>
if you keep my commands.<br>
This commandment I give to you:<br>
That you love one another,<br>
each one as your brother (sister),<br>
Each one as I love you.<br>

I am the Vine, my Father the Vinegrower<br>
Who is looking for fruits of love.<br>
Barren branches He prunes off,<br>
fruitful branches<br>
He trims clean, trims clean of all selfishness.<br>

My Father will send you another Paraclete<br>
To be with you always, always.<br>
He's the Spirit of truth,<br>
He's the Spirit of peace, Spirit of unity.<br>
<br>
# D.111<span> WHEN THE KINGDOM OF OUR GOD<br>

When the kindness of our God was revealed in Jesus,<br>
With compassion and with love were we born.<br>
In the spirit of that love, life abounds with thankfulness,<br>
For the gift we know in Jesus the Christ.<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**May the grace of God be ever in our life,**<br>
**With a song may gratitude become our home,**<br>
**Alleluia, alleluia,  alleluia, alleluia!**<br>

With the gentleness of peace, born in love of God as friend<br>
So much healing and forgiveness shall we know.<br>
And with peace is sure to come such a deep abiding joy<br>
Which the many deaths of life cannot dispel.<br>

In diverse and sundry ways of the past did God reveal<br>
Something of the love in which life can thrive.<br>
But in Jesus did this love come to fullness for all time.<br>
And in Him we are alive with spirit joy.<br>
<br>
# D.112<span> TAKE, EAT AND HUNGER NO LONGER<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Take, eat and hunger no longer,**<br>
**For I am the bread of life.**<br>
**Take, drink, this wine will refresh you,**<br>
**My cup overflows with love for you.**<br>

I am the living bread, broken for people.<br>
You are the vessels of silver and clay.<br>
Come and partake of the love that I offer.<br>
Then share it with others each day.<br>

Just as my Father has sent me to feed you,<br>
So must you now feed your neighbours in need.<br>
Don't be afraid for I'll always be with you.<br>
My spirit will guide you along.<br>

I lead you out of the power of darkness,<br>
I bring you safe to the kingdom of life.<br>
I set you free thru the Spirit I send you.<br>
Come forward to spread the good news.<br>
<br>
# D.113<span> I HAVE LOVED YOU<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**I have loved you with an everlasting love,**<br>
**I have called you and you are mine. (2)**<br>

Seek the face of the Lord and long for Him,<br>
He will bring you his light and his peace.<br>

...His joy and His hope.<br>

...His care and His love.<br>
<br>
# D.115<span> LORD, MAKE ME LIKE YOU<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Lord, make me like you, please,**<br>
**make me like you.**<br>
**You are a servant, make me one too.**<br>
**O Lord won't you give me your strength every day**<br>
**To build a community, to follow your way.**<br>

Whoever among you desires to be great,<br>
Must be the servant of all.<br>
For even the Son of man came to serve<br>
And give his life for the world.<br>

You call me your Master and Lord, so I am.<br>
See, I have washed your feet<br>
To set an example for all of you<br>
Of service and of love.<br>

The Spirit anoints me and calls me by name<br>
To bring Good News to the poor,<br>
Release to the captives and sight to the blind,<br>
To set the prisoners free.<br>
<br>
# D.117<span> CAUSE ME TO COME<br>

Cause me to come to your river, O Lord,<br>
Cause me to come to your river, O Lord, (2)<br>
Cause me to come, cause me to drink,<br>
cause me to live.<br>

Speak, Lord, your Word: I am listening to you<br>
Speak, Lord, your Word: I am listening to you, (2)<br>
Speak to my mind, speak to my will,<br>
speak to my heart.<br>

Feed me, O Lord, with your body and blood<br>
Feed me, O Lord, with your body and blood, (2)<br>
Strengthen my mind, strengthen my will.<br>
strengthen my heart.<br>
<br>
# D.118<span> WHATSOEVER YOU DO<br>

You see me hungry, lying on the footpath,<br>
I need your love and care to quench my thirst,<br>
I’m looking for some decent clothes and shelter.<br>
O see the state I’m in, the very worst!<br>
You’ll find me in the hospital so weary,<br>
Imprisoned by my loneliness so great,<br>
The victim of man’s cruel exploitation.<br>
How can you ever leave me to my fate?<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Whatsoever you do to set your brother free,**<br>
**Whatsoever you do to end his misery,**<br>
**Whatsoever you do to bring him liberty,**<br>
**Whatsoever you do, you do it unto Me.**<br>

Perhaps you’ll help to find me some employment<br>
Or say a word to calm my anxious fears,<br>
Be brave to fight with me against injustice<br>
Or sit by me and lend a listening ear.<br>
At times I need a word of consolation,<br>
The joy of seeing you standing by my side,<br>
I promise that your love will be rewarded,<br>
O come, you blessed and in heav’n abide.<br>
<br>
# D.120<span> TAKE AND EAT<br>

Gather at the altar, share the holy bread,<br>
Join in celebration of the words He said:<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Take and eat; this is my body.**<br>
**Take and drink for this is my blood.**<br>

We are all invited to the sacred meal;<br>
Food and drink he offers all our sins to heal.<br>

By the bread I give you, life will be restored.<br>
You will be my people, I will be your Lord.<br>

By the cup I offer, know that you are mine,<br>
Know that I am with you to the end of time.<br>

We must now pass over from the land of sin,<br>
Let the Holy Spirit write his law within.<br>

When you share this supper,<br>
When you drink this wine,<br>
You proclaim my dying till the end of time.<br>
<br>
# D.121<span> LET THERE BE LOVE<br>

Let there be love shared among us,<br>
Let there be love in our eyes,<br>
May now Your love sweep this nation,<br>
Cause us, O Lord, to arise.<br>
Give us a fresh understanding<br>
Of brotherly (sisterly) love that is real,<br>
Let there be love shared among us,<br>
Let there be love.<br>

Let there be peace shared among us,<br>
Let there be peace in our eyes,<br>
May now Your peace sweep this nation,<br>
Cause us, O Lord, to arise.<br>
Give us a fresh understanding<br>
Of brotherly (sisterly) peace that is real,<br>
Let there be peace shared among us,<br>
Let there be peace.<br>

Let there be joy shared among us,<br>
Let there be joy in our eyes,<br>
May now Your joy sweep this nation,<br>
Cause us, O Lord, to arise.<br>
Give us a fresh understanding<br>
Of brotherly (sisterly) joy that is real,<br>
Let there be joy shared among us,<br>
Let there be joy.<br>
<br>
# D.122<span> LOSE YOURSELF IN ME<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Lose yourself in me and you will find yourself,**<br>
**Lose yourself in me and you will find new life.**<br>
**Lose yourself in me and you will find yourself,**<br>
**And you will live, yes, you will live in my love.**<br>

Unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground,<br>
It still remains but a grain of wheat.<br>
But if it falls and dies, then it bears much fruit,<br>
So it is with those who lose themselves in me.<br>

Though foxes have their dens, birds a little nest,<br>
The Son of man no place to rest.<br>
Whoever loves his life or strives the world to gain,<br>
Will only find that life was lived in vain.<br>

If we have died with Him, we shall live with Him.<br>
If we endure, we'll reign with Him.<br>
Though faithless we may be,<br>
faithful He'll remain,<br>
For how can Christ be false unto Himself?<br>
<br>
# D.124<span> HE WHO DRINKS OF THE WATER<br>

He who drinks of the water that I give him<br>
ne'er again will he seek other water;<br>
My gift will stay with him like a fountain<br>
That renews him in Spirit.<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**If you but knew what a gift God is offering**<br>
**And who it is that has asked you for water,**<br>
**You'd be the one who would ask him to give you**<br>
**That living water for eternal life.**<br>

Come to me, all who thirst and are weary;<br>
Come, be quenched at the fountain of freshness.<br>
Streams of living water will flow forth<br>
From my heart in abundance.<br>

On the cross while the Son of God lay hanging,<br>
He was pierced by the lance of a soldier;<br>
And from the very heart of the Saviour,<br>
Lo, there came blood and water.<br>

We were starving and thirsting in the desert,<br>
Weak and weary for want of water<br>
But when Moses struck the rock at Massah,<br>
Water gushed out in torrents.<br>
<br>
# D.125<span> I AM THE LIVING BREAD<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**I am the living Bread that came from heaven**<br>
**And all who eat it will live for ever.**<br>
**The bread that I will give will be my own flesh**<br>
**And I will offer it to give you Life.**<br>

If you reject my flesh or fail to drink my blood<br>
I tell you solemnly, there'll be no life in you.<br>
If you do trust in me and do as I command,<br>
You'll have eternal life and live with me.<br>

My flesh is real food, my blood is real drink,<br>
He who does what I say will find my life in him,<br>
My Father gives me life when I do live in Him,<br>
That same life you will get, taking this bread.<br>

This is my sacrament which feeds my people.<br>
I grant them holiness and give them life divine<br>
So that they'll all be one, united in my love.<br>
I'll lead them with my hand to share my life.<br>
<br>
# D.126<span> JESUS STAND AMONG US<br>

Jesus, stand among us at the meeting of our lives,<br>
Be our sweet agreement at the meeting of our eyes.<br>
O Jesus, we love You, so we gather here,<br>
Join our hearts in unity and take away fear.<br>

So to you we're gathering out of each<br>
and ev'ry land,<br>
Christ, the love between us<br>
at the joining of our hands.<br>

Jesus, stand among us<br>
at the breaking of the bread,<br>
Join us as one body as<br>
we worship You, our head.<br>
<br>
# D.127<span> SEEK YOU FIRST<br>

Seek you first the kingdom of God and his righteousness<br>
And all these things shall be added unto you.<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Halleluiah! (7)**<br>

Man shall not live  by bread alone<br>
But by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.<br>

Ask and it shall be given unto you<br>
Seek and you shall find, knock and<br>
It shall be opened to you.<br>

If the Son shall set you free,<br>
You shall be free indeed, you’ll know the truth<br>
And the truth shall set you free.<br>

Let your light so shine before all<br>
That they may see your good works<br>
And glorify your Father in heaven.<br>
<br>
# D.129<span> PEACE I GIVE TO YOU<br>

Peace I give to you, to all of you, my friends,<br>

Live as one united family.<br>
<br>
# D.130<span> MY PEACE<br>

My peace I give unto you,<br>
It’s a peace that the world cannot give.<br>
It’s a peace that the world cannot understand.<br>
Peace to know, peace to live.<br>
My peace I give unto you.<br>
<br>
# D.131<span> O LET THE SON OF GOD<br>

O let the Son of God enfold you<br>
With his Spirit and his love,<br>
Let him fill your heart and satisfy your soul.<br>
O let him have the things that hold you,<br>
And his Spirit like a dove will descend upon your life<br>
And make you whole.<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Jesus, we thank you for your word of truth,**<br>
**Jesus, we thank you for the bread of life.**<br>

O come and sing this song with gladness<br>
As your hearts are filled with joy,<br>
Lift your hands in brave surrender to his name.<br>
O give Him all your tears and sadness,<br>
Give Him all your years of pain,<br>
And you'll enter into life in Jesus' name.<br>
<br>
# D.132<span> AS THE DEER<br>

As the deer pants for the water,<br>
So my soul longs after you.<br>
You alone are my heart’s desire<br>
And I long to worship You.<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**You alone are my strength, my shield,**<br>
**To You alone may my Spirit yield.**<br>
**You alone are my heart’s desire**<br>
**And I long to worship you.**<br>

I want You more than gold and silver,<br>
Only You can satisfy.<br>
You alone are the real joy-giver<br>
And the apple of my eye.<br>

You’re my friend and You are my brother<br>
Even though You are my Lord.<br>
I love You more than any other,<br>
So much more than anything.<br>
<br>
# D.133<span> GATHER US TOGETHER<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Lord Jesus Christ, gather us together.**<br>
**Make us one bread, one body in your love.**<br>

Gather your people who long to be one,<br>
One with You, O Lord, in truth and love.<br>

We do proclaim You, the Saviour of all,<br>
Lord of all the earth in sea and sky.<br>

Forgive our failings, create us anew.<br>
Speak your words of peace into our hearts.<br>

Into your hands, Lord, we place all our cares,<br>
Trusting in your name which never fails.<br>

Within your temple your praises we sing.<br>
Glorious is your name o'er all the earth.<br>
<br>
# D.134<span> BREAD FOR THE WORLD<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Bread for the world: a world of hunger.**<br>
**Wine for all peoples: people who thirst.**<br>
**May we who eat be bread for others.**<br>
**May we who drink pour out our love.**<br>

Lord Jesus Christ, you are the bread of life,<br>
Broken to reach and heal the wounds of human pain.<br>
Where we divide your people<br>
you are waiting there<br>
On bended knee to wash our feet<br>
with endless care.<br>

Lord Jesus Christ, you are the wine of peace,<br>
Poured into hearts once broken and<br>
where dryness sleeps.<br>
Where we are tired and weary<br>
you are waiting there<br>
To be the way which beckons us beyond despair.<br>

Lord Jesus Christ, you call us to your feast,<br>
At which the rich and powerful have become the least.<br>
Where we survive on others in our human greed<br>
You walk among us begging for your every need.<br>
<br>
# D.135<span> YOU SATISFY THE HUNGRY<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**You satisfy the hungry heart**<br>
**With gift of finest wheat.**<br>
**Come, give to us, O saving Lord,**<br>
**The bread of life to eat.**<br>

As when the shepherd calls his sheep,<br>
They know and heed his voice,<br>
So when You call your family,<br>
We follow and rejoice.<br>

With joyful lips we sing to you<br>
Our praise and gratitude,<br>
That You should count us worthy, Lord,<br>
To share this heavenly food.<br>

Is not the cup we bless and share<br>
The blood of Christ outpoured?<br>
Do not one cup, one loaf declare<br>
Our oneness in the Lord?<br>

The mystery of your presence, Lord,<br>
No normal tongue can tell;<br>
Whom all the world cannot contain<br>
Comes in our heart to dwell.<br>

You give Yourself to us, O Lord;<br>
Then selfless let us be,<br>
To serve each other in your name,<br>
In truth and charity.<br>
<br>
# D.136<span> TAKE THIS BREAD<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Take this bread: it is my body.**<br>
**Take this cup: it is my blood.**<br>
**I will give you life eternal,**<br>
**One day I will raise you up.**<br>

You are the bread come down from  heaven,<br>
Bread of God which give us life:<br>
He who eats and who believes<br>
Will never hunger, never thirst.<br>

Whoever comes to You believing,<br>
Never will be turned away:<br>
You have come to do the will<br>
Of Him who sent You with life for all.<br>

Well may we hear the words You give us,<br>
Words of God and Word of life.<br>
Build our faith and teach us how<br>
To follow you and be one with God.
