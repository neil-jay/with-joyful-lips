DD.1<br>
This is my commandment<br>
Love one another as I have loved you (2)<br>

Charity is kind, feels no envy<br>
Charity bears up to the end<br>
Charity is meek, seeking not its own<br>
Charity has faith to the end<br>

Charity is mild, thinks no evil<br>
Charity can hope to the end<br>
Charity is just, finding joy in truth<br>
Charity is patient to the end<br>

Charity is never conceited<br>
Charity brings joy to the end<br>
Charity is never resentful<br>
Charity makes peace to the end<br>

I may speak in tongues, be a prophet<br>
Understand every mystery<br>
Even though my faith may move mountains<br>
With no love, I’m nothing at all<br>

I may give away my possessions<br>
Even give my body to be burnt<br>
If I have no love, I’m no better<br>
For of all the greatest is love<br>
<br>
D.3<br>
Prayer for Unity<br>
Ref. 1:	Gracious Lord, deign to gather in your Kingdom<br>
All the peoples who fill the universe<br>

Ref.2:	Save us Lord, gather us from all the nations<br>
To give glory unto your holy name<br>

As grains of wheat in the host<br>
Form the Bread of Life<br>
And as the grapes are pressed<br>
To make the precious Wine<br>
Help us to keep this unity<br>
In the bond of peace and charity<br>

O God of Love, shed your light<br>
Over all the earth<br>
Give us the strength to spread<br>
Fraternal love and zeal<br>
To kindle all humanity<br>
With the mighty flame of charity<br>

Companions all, from the towns<br>
From the countryside<br>
From every plain and field<br>
From vale and mountain height<br>
Come ‘neath the shadow of the cross<br>
One in faith and trust, in Jesus Christ<br>
<br>
D.6<br>
I’ve received the living Bread<br>
Ant.1:<br>
I’ve received the living Bread and my heart is filled with joy (2)<br>

Ant.2:	Every one who lives in me shall obtain eternal life (2)<br>

He says to me: I am the Bread<br>
Which I give to feed your soul<br>
He who eats of this my flesh<br>
Will attain the heav’nly goal<br>

He says to me: I am the Vine<br>
Which will nourish every shoot<br>
As it feeds upon my sap<br>
It will give abundant fruit<br>

He says to me: I am the Life<br>
Which destroys eternal doom<br>
Whosoever lives in me<br>
Will rise like me from the tomb<br>

He says to me: I am the Way<br>
Where my Father waits for you;<br>
If you follow in my steps<br>
You will see me with him too<br>

He says to me: I am the Light<br>
In the darkness of your night<br>
Whosoever welcomes me<br>
Will be led on paths aright<br>
<br>
D.13<br>
With you as my guide, I’ll not want:<br>
You are my Shepherd, Lord, nothing shall I fear<br>

In pastures fresh and green<br>
You give my soul response<br>
Near cool and restful waters<br>
My spirit you revive<br>

In vales of gloom and death<br>
No evil shall I dread<br>
Your strength and peaceful presence<br>
Will be my comfort sure<br>

A banquet you have spread<br>
While foes in envy watch<br>
My head you have anointed<br>
My cup now overflows<br>

Your loving favour, Lord<br>
Shall surely follow me<br>
Until one day in heaven<br>
For ever shall I dwell<br>
<br>
D.18<br>
Sing my soul at the joy that I feel<br>
There is now, dwelling in me, my God<br>

It is through you, Lord, that I act,<br>
Ev’ry prayer, ev’ry thought of mine<br>
Comes from you, Lord divine<br>

Lord, it is your wish, that I may<br>
By my life, show people around<br>
How to love, more and more<br>

It is to you, Lord, that I turn<br>
When in need and my heart is grieved<br>
For your love brings me joy<br>

Lord, it is your wish that my life<br>
In this world brings abundant fruit<br>
For the kingdom of heaven<br>
<br>
D.19<br>

You are our gladness for ever<br>

You are the Truth, the Light, alleluia<br>

You are the Life, O Christ, alleluia<br>
One who abides in you, for ever shall live, alleluia<br>

You are the Word of God, alleluia<br>
Who has revealed the Father’s love to the world alleluia<br>

Praise to the Father, Son and Spirit divine, alleluia<br>
<br>
D.23<br>
This is my will, my one command<br>
That love should dwell among you all<br>
This is my will that you should love<br>
As I have shown that I love you<br>

No greater love a man can have<br>
Than that he die to save his friends<br>
You are my friends if you obey<br>
What I command that you should do<br>

I call you now no longer slaves<br>
No slave knows all his master does<br>
I call you friends for all I hear<br>
My Father say, you hear from me<br>

You chose not me, but I chose you<br>
That you should go and bear much fruit<br>
I chose you out that you in me<br>
Should bear much fruit that will abide<br>

All that you ask my Father dear<br>
For my name’s sake you shall receive<br>
This is my will, my one command<br>
That love should dwell in each, in all<br>
<br>
D.27<br>
Whatsoever you do to the least of my people, that you do unto me<br>

When I was hungry, you gave me to eat<br>	
When I was thirsty, you gave me to drink<br>
Now enter into the home of my Father<br>

When I was weary, you helped me find rest<br>
When I was anxious, you calmed all my fears<br>

When I was homeless, you opened your door<br>
When I was naked, you gave me your coat<br>

When I as little, you taught me to read<br>
When I was lonely, you gave me your love<br>

When in a prison, you came to my cell<br>
When on a sick bed, you cared for my needs<br>

In a strange country, you made me at home<br>
Seeking employment, you found me a job<br>

When I was laughed at, you stood by my side<br>
When I was happy, you shared in my joy<br>
<br>
D.29<br>
Jesus always loved His own<br>

Jesus always loved his own<br>
and he showed it to the full<br>
When at supper from the table<br>
He got up and took a towel<br>
Then he wrapped it round His waist<br>
in a basin water poured<br>
Then began to wash the feet of all his friends<br>
Know, my people, what I’ve done to you<br>
Lord you call me, It is what I am<br>
If then I, your Lord, deigned to wash your feet<br>
You should do the same and wash each other’s feet.<br>

When He came to Simon Peter<br>
the apostle said to him<br>
“Never shall you wash my feet”<br>
Then the Lord replied to him<br>
“It is not for you to know what now I do”<br>

….When He said to Simon Peter<br>
“If I do not wash your feet,<br>
You can have no part with me”<br>
Then said Peter to his Lord:<br>
“Wash my hands, my head and not my feet alone”<br>

…. He has set us an example that we do as He has done<br>
Can a servant greater be than his master Christ, the Lord?<br>
If we know and do this, happy we shall be<br>
<br>
DD.36<br>
Christ’s love for us<br>

Love is his word, love is his way<br>
Feasting with all, fasting alone<br>
Living and dying, rising again<br>
Love, only love his way<br>
Richer than gold is the love of my Lord;<br>
Better than splendour and wealth (2)<br>

Love is his way, love is his mark<br>
Sharing his last Passover feast<br>
Christ at his table, host to the twelve<br>
Love, only love is his mark<br>

Love is his mark, love is his sign<br>
Bread of our strength, wine for our joy<br>
“This is my body, This is my blood”<br>
Love, only love, is his sign<br>

Love is his name, love is his law<br>
Hear his command, all who are his<br>
“Love one another, as I have loved you”<br>
Love, only love is his law<br>
<br>
D.37<br>
Take, eat, this is my Body<br>
Take, drink of this cup<br>
Poured for your and for many<br>
Do this in remembrance of me<br>

I am the living bread, come down from heaven<br>
Anyone who eats this bread, will live for ever<br>

He who eats of this, my flesh, and drinks my saving blood<br>
Shall abide in me, and I abide in him<br>

For my flesh is food indeed, my blood is really drink<br>
Those who eat and drink, will have eternal life<br>
<br>
D43.<br>
The Lord is my Shepherd<br>

The Lord is my shepherd<br>
There is nothing I shall want<br>
Fresh and green are the pastures<br>
Where he gives me repose<br>
Near restful waters he leads me<br>
To revive my drooping spirit<br>

Ref:<br>
The Lord is my shepherd<br>
There is nothing I shall want<br>
Yes, the Lord is my shepherd<br>
There is nothing I shall want<br>

He guides me along<br>
What he knows to be right<br>
If I walk in the darkness<br>
No evil would I fear<br>
I know that he will be there<br>
With his crook and with his staff<br>

The Lord has prepared<br>
Such banquet for me<br>
Surely goodness and kindness<br>
No evil would I fear<br>
Shall follow after me<br>
In the Lord’s own house shall I dwell<br>
All the days of my life<br>
<br>
D.44<br>
No one can give to me<br> 
That peace which my risen Lord<br>
My risen King can give (2)<br>

When I look around and see<br>
All the things that trouble me<br>
And I seem to lose my peace<br>
In a world that’s not at ease<br>

Says my risen Christ to me<br>
My true peace I give to thee<br>
But not as the world doth give<br>
Is my peace that makes one live<br>

His true peace in me will stay<br>
As I live from day to day<br>
And his joy will never end<br>
And in heaven it will extend<br>

Christ has risen from the dead<br>
Triumphed over sin and death<br>
And he’ll never die again<br>
But as Lord he’ll live and reign<br>
<br>
D.46<br>
Take this all of you eat of this my flesh<br>
Take this is my blood shed for sinners all<br>
For my life I give and my love I share:<br>
Trust and believe in me<br>

Truly I say, my brethren<br>
Should you not drink my blood<br>
Should you not eat my body<br>
You have no life in you<br>

Work for the food that’s lasting<br>
Work not for food that spoils<br>
Work for the bread from heaven<br>
And gain eternal life<br>

I am the resurrection<br>
I am the bread of life<br>
One who has faith enduring<br>
Will live for ever<br>
<br>
D.49<br>
O Lord, I’m not worthy<br>
Yet you come to live in me<br>
So speak your word of comfort<br>
By your touch strengthen and heal me<br>

Take this and eat my body<br>
And drink my saving blood<br>
Poured out for your redemption<br>
A symbol of my love<br>

Called to be God’s new people<br>
Made one in Christ the Lord<br>
Let us with hearts united<br>
Bear witness of your love<br>

Onward through life we journey<br>
As seekers of the truth<br>
Building each day a new world<br>
Of justice, peace and love<br>
<br>
D.51<br>
Make me a channel of your peace<br>

Make me a channel of your peace<br>
Where there is hatred, let me bring your love<br>
Where there is injury, your pardon Lord<br>
And where there’s doubt, true faith in you<br>
Oh Master, grant that I may never seek<br>
So much to be consoled as to console<br>
To be understood as to understand<br>
To be loved as to love with all my soul<br>

Make me a channel of your peace<br>
Where there’s despair in life, let bring hope<br>
Where there is darkness, only light<br>
And where there’s sadness, ever joy<br>

Make me a channel of your peace<br>
It is in pardoning that we are pardoned<br>
In giving to each one that we receive<br>
And in dying that we’re born to eternal life<br>
<br>
D.52<br>
Come, Jesus, come into this heart of stone<br>
Come, Jesus, come into this heart of stone<br>
Melt and mould it and make it your own<br>
Come, Jesus, come into this heart of stone<br>
	
I’m not ashamed to tell you Lord<br>
That I’m a sinner man<br>
I just love to do the things<br>
That go against your plan<br>

Love your neighbour as yourself<br>
Is what you command<br>
But his sufferings, tears and pain<br>
Is something I can’t stand<br>

When my neighbour’s hungry<br>
And naked in the street<br>
I just cannot bear to see<br>
And from him I retreat<br>

You want me to be the salt<br>
And leaven in the dough<br>
But I prefer to stand aloof<br>
And let the world just go<br>

I want to change myself<br>
I don’t wanna be a stone<br>
I need your Spirit Lord<br>
Cause I cant do it alone<br>
<br>
D.58<br>
Let all that is within me, cry holy (2)<br>
Holy, holy, holy is the Lamb that was slain<br>

…. Mighty<br>

…….worthy<br>

…..blessed<br>

D.65<br>
Lord, you are my everything<br>
Lord, you are my friend<br>
In this Bread you promise me<br>
Life that has no end<br>

Come, my strength, my Bread of life<br>
Hold me your sway<br>
Fill me with your presence, Lord<br>
Guide me on my way<br>

Come, my Way, my Truth, my Life<br>
Show me how to live<br>
Clear the storms that cloud my path<br>
Teach me to forgive<br>

Come, my Joy, my Love, my Heart<br>
Come to me and stay<br>
Speak your tender words of peace<br>
To my heart to-day<br>
<br>
D.66<br>
We have received the Bread of Life<br>
Joy fills our hearts again<br>
We have received the Risen Christ<br>
Jesus in us will reign<br>

I am the Bread, he said<br>
That will feed your soul<br>
Eat of this, my flesh<br>
Reach the heav’nly goal<br>

I am the Vine… Nourishing each shoot<br>
Live upon my sap, Give abundant fruit<br>

I am the life… Life all people prize<br>
If you live in me, With me you will rise<br>

I am the Way… By which you all should go<br>
Following in my steps, My Father you will know<br>

I am the Peace…. No other peace endures<br>
I am the only love, Which my peace ensures<br>

I am the Lamb… Sacrificed for your<br>
Take up your cross and be my disciple true<br>
<br>
D.89<br>
To be the body of the Lord in this world<br>
To have his Spirit coursing through my soul<br>
To know the passion of my Jesus in his love for every one<br>
To show his mercy in the shadows of this land<br>

Come, walk with me come share my life<br>
You must know the shadows<br>
If you would know the light<br>

No eyes have I, no ears to hear<br>
You must be my body<br>
And show my Father’s care<br>

I am the vine, branches are you<br>
Life from me eternal<br>
To make your world anew<br>

One bread, one cup; one heart and mind<br>
One great human people<br>
In fellowship divine<br>
<br>
D.90<br>	
Bread that was sown in our hills and valleys<br>
Now harvested, becomes one<br>
From all the world gather your people O Lord<br>
Into the feast of your love<br>

With grateful hearts, we sing our joy<br>
For knowing the Spirit within, among us all<br>
Life and knowledge, revealed through your word<br>
Jesus, the Christ, Emmanuel<br>

Leaven and Wheat; so let us be for others<br>
Nurturing good with earnest care<br>
Bringing to birth new life where hope has gone stale<br>
Faith-giving moments to share<br>
<br>
D.93<br>
Bind us together Lord, Lord bind us together<br>
With cords that cannot be broken<br>
Bind us together Lord, Lord (2)<br>
Bind us together with love<br>

There is only one God, there is only one King<br>
There is only one Body, that is why I sing<br>

Though there are many branches<br>
There is only one Vine<br>
We are one in Christ Jesus, that is why…<br>

One with Christ in his death<br>
That, as one, we might rise<br>
So we are but one people, that is why…..<br>

There is only one table<br>
Christ alone is our host<br>
He invites us together, that is why….<br>
<br>
D.94<br>
Yours is the Kingdom, Yours is the Power<br>
Yours is the glory evermore<br>
Lord, forever, Lord for evermore<br>

From the ends of all earth<br>
And out beyond the stars<br>
Gathered in your presence we are one<br>

One in the bread we break<br>
And one in our concern<br>
One with you we celebrate this day<br>

Freedom is your gift for all<br>
Who live and die in you<br>
Freedom is finding life in you<br>

Broken bread is scattered on<br>
The hillsides and the plains<br>
Broken hearts and bodies cry for rest<br>
<br>
D.96<br>
God is good to me<br>

God is good to me O what love I see<br>
Jesus as a lamb was slain<br>
He delivered me, cleansed and set me free<br>
Lord of all, He rose again<br>
Now I live, yet not I<br>
Jesus is alive in me<br>
Sending the Spirit’s flame into my heart again<br>
God has poured his love on me<br>

God has shown his love, sent his only Son<br>
Jesus Christ to save the world<br>
Life eternal through his death He brought<br>
Yes, believe that God is Love<br>

God is perfect Love, one who lives in love<br>
Lives in God and God in him<br>
Yes, I feel his love; fear gives way to peace<br>
Cause I know He loved me first<br>
<br>
D.99<br>
Make me an instrument<br>

Make me an instrument of your peace;<br>
Where there is hatred, let me bring love<br>
Where there is injury, your pardon Lord<br>
and where there’s doubt, true faith in you<br>

Where there’s discouragement, let me bring hope<br>
Where there is darkness, let me bring your light<br>
and where there’s sadness let me bring joy<br>

It is in pardoning that we are pardoned<br>
It is in giving that we do receive<br>
and it’s in dying that we’re born to life<br>
<br>
D.100<br>
Come to my Father through me (2)<br>
I’m the way, the truth and the life<br>
Come to my Father through me<br>

Do not let your hearts be troubled<br>
Over things you shouldn’t bother<br>
Just trust in my Father and in me<br>
And all things will follow<br>

Lord, we do not have an idea<br>
Where you are going<br>
So how can we follow the way?<br>
Teach us, we pray you<br>

Words that I have spoken<br>
I do not speak on my own<br>
But the Father who dwells in me<br>
Does his works through me<br>

I am the way, the truth<br>
I am the Life<br>
No one can come to the Father<br>
But only through me<br>
<br>
D.104<br>
Make me a servant, humble and meek<br>
Lord, let me lift up those who are weak<br>
And may the prayer of heart always be<br>
Make me a servant, make me a servant<br>
Make me a servant to-day<br>

Even though you were in the form of God<br>
You took the form of a slave<br>
You accepted death even on a cross<br>
So God exalted your name<br>

Ere you formed me in my mother’s womb<br>
You called me by my name<br>
And you touched my mouth and appointed me<br>
A prophet to the world<br>

May I heal the sick and the crippled bind<br>
Bring back the sheep that stray<br>
May I seek the lost and the weak make strong<br>
With justice feed the poor<br>
<br>
D.105<br>
My heart’s like a flute and I want to play all day<br>
Jesus Christ is my music master<br>
Deep from my heart flows a simple melody,<br> 
Great is his love, love without end (2)<br>

Once I met the Lord on the way;<br>
Deep was his gaze, kind was his smile<br>
True were his words, gentle his touch<br>
He brought me peace and freedom<br>

He’s my shepherded He’s my guide<br>
Dark be the night, Christ is my light<br>
Nothing I fear, Jesus is near<br>
He leads me to the Kingdom<br>

T’wards the land of promise we walk<br>
There to find peace, there to find joy<br>
There to find love, God has prepared<br>
A banquet for his people<br>
<br>
D.106<br>
To become the bread of rejoicing<br>
To become the wine of your love<br>
To become the song of your gladness<br>
To become your body, O Lord, Jesus Christ<br>

See, O Lord, the bread of our pain<br>
The bread we knead with our hands worn by sorrow<br>
The bread of our grief, the bread of our suffering<br>
Give us on this day, O Lord<br>
Give us our daily bread<br>

See, O Lord, the bread of our toil<br>
The bread we sow which is ripe now for harvest<br>
The bread of our work, the bread of our labour<br>
Give….<br>

See, O Lord, the bread of our love<br>
The bread we bread and we share with each other<br>
The hearts that we give bring joy to the lonely….<br>

See, O Lord, the bread of our life<br>
The bread of heaven which brightens our pathway<br>
The bread of the way that leads to the kingdom…<br>

See, O Lord, the wine of our joy<br>
The wine which flows from the grapes of our vineyards<br>
The joy of the earth, the wine of our feasting….<br>
<br>
D.111<br>
When the kindness of our God<br>

When the kindness of our God was revealed in Jesus<br>
With compassion and with love were we born<br>
In the spirit of that love, life abounds with thankfulness<br>
For the gift we know in Jesus the Christ<br>
May the grace of God be ever in our life<br>
With a song may gratitude become our home<br>
Alleluia, alleluia,  alleluia, alleluia<br>

With the gentleness of peace, born in love of God as friend<br>
So much healing and forgiveness shall we know<br>
And with peace is sure to come such a deep abiding joy<br>
Which the many deaths of life cannot dispel<br>

In diverse and sundry ways of the past did God reveal<br>
Something of the love in which life can thrive<br>
But in Jesus did this love come to fullness for all time<br>
And in Him we are alive with Spirit joy<br>
<br>
D.113<br>
I have loved you with an everlasting love<br>
I have called you and you are mine (2)<br>

Seek the face of the Lord and long for Him<br>
He will bring you his light and his peace<br>

…. His joy and His hope<br>

….. His care and His love<br>
<br>
D.118<br>
Whatsoever you do<br>

You see me hungry, lying on the footpath<br>
I need your love and care to quench my thirst<br>
I’m looking for some decent clothes and shelter<br>
O see the state I’m in, the very worst<br>
You’ll find me in the hospital so weary<br>
Imprisoned by my loneliness so great<br>
The victim of man’s cruel exploitation<br>
How can you ever leave me to my fate?<br>
Whatsoever you do to set your brother free<br>
Whatsoever you do to end his misery<br>
Whatsoever you do to bring him liberty<br>
Whatsoever you do, you do it unto Me<br>

Perhaps you’ll help to find me some employment<br>
Or say a word to calm my anxious fears<br>
Be brave to fight with me against injustice<br>
Or sit by me an lend a listening ear<br>
At times I need a word of consolation<br>
The joy of seeing you standing by my side<br>
I promise that your love will be rewarded<br>
O come, you blessed and in heav’n abide<br>
<br>
D.120<br>
Take and eat<br>

Gather at the altar, share the holy bread<br>
Join in celebration of the words He said:<br>
Take and eat; this is my body<br>
Take and drink for this is my blood<br>

We are all invited to the sacred meal<br>
Food and drink he offers all our sins to heal<br>

By the bread I give you, life will be restored<br>
You will be my people, I will be your Lord<br>

By the cup I offer, know that you are mine<br>
Know that I am with you to the end of time<br>

We must now pass over from the land of sin<br>
Let the Holy Spirit write his law within<br>

When you share this supper<br>
When you drink this wine<br>
You proclaim my dying till the end of time<br>
<br>
D.121<br>
Let there be Love<br>

Let there be love shared among us<br>
Let there be love in our eyes<br>
May now Your love sweep this nation<br>
Cause us, O Lord to arise<br>
Give us a fresh understanding<br>
Of brotherly (sisterly) love that is real<br>
Let there be love shared among us, let there be love<br>

….. Peace….<br>
….  Joy ….<br>

D.127<br>
Seek you first<br>

Seek you first the kingdom of God and his righteousness<br>
And all these things shall be added unto you<br>

Halleluiah (7)<br>

Man shall not live  by bread alone<br>
But by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God<br>

Ask and it shall be given unto you<br>
Seek and you shall find knock and it shall be opened to you<br>

If the Son shall set you free<br>
You shall be free indeed, you’ll know the truth<br>
And the truth shall set you free<br>

Let your light so shine before all<br>
That they may see your good works<br>
And glorify your Father in heaven<br>

D.130<br>
My peace I give unto you<br>
It’s a peace that the world cannot give<br>
It’s a peace that the world cannot understand<br>
Peace to know, peace to live<br>
My peace I give unto you<br>
<br>
D.132<br>	
As the deer pants for the water<br>
So my soul longs after you<br>
You alone are my heart’s desire<br>
And I long to worship You<br>
You alone are my strength, my shield<br>
To You alone may my Spirit yield<br>
You alone are my heart’s desire<br>
And I long to worship you<br>

I want You more than gold and silver<br>
Only You can satisfy<br>
You alone are the real joy-giver<br>
And the apple of my eye<br>

You’re my friend and You are my brother<br>
Even though You are my Lord<br>
I love You more than any other<br>
So much more than anything<br>
<br>
D.136<br>
Take this bread: It is my body<br>
Take this cup: it is my blood<br>
I will give you life eternal<br>
One day I will raise you up<br>

You are the bread come down from  heaven<br>
Bread of God which give us life<br>
He who eats and who believes<br>
Will never hunger, never thirst<br>

Whoever comes to You believing<br>
Never will be turned away<br>
You have come to do the will<br>
Of Him who sent You with life for all<br>

Well may we hear the words You give us<br>
Words of God and Word of life<br>
Build our faith and teach us how<br>
To follow you and be one with God
