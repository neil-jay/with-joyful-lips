I know that you are very young,<br>
But I will make you strong,<br>
I’ll fill you with my word;<br>
And you will travel through the land,<br>
Fulfilling my command which you have heard.<br>

And everywhere you are to go,<br>
My hand will follow you,<br>
you will not be alone.<br>
In all the danger that you fear,<br>
You’ll find me very near, your words my own.<br>

With all my strength you will be filled:<br>
You will destroy and build:<br>
for that is my design.<br>
You will create and overthrow,<br>
Reap harvests I will sow:<br>
your word is mine.<br>

All who dwell in dark and sin,<br>

I who made the stars of night,<br>
I will make their darkness bright.<br>
Who will bear my light to them?<br>
Whom shall I send?<br>

I, the Lord of snow and rain,<br>
I have borne my people’s pain,<br>
I have wept for love of them,<br>
they turn away.<br>
I will break their hearts of stone,<br>
Give them hearts for love alone.<br>
I will speak my word to them:<br>
Whom shall I send?<br>

I the Lord of wind and flame,<br>
I will tend the poor and lame,<br>
I will set a feast for them,<br>
my hand will save.<br>
Finest bread I will provide<br>
Till their hearts be satisfied.<br>
I will give my life to them:<br>
Whom shall I send?<br>

To search for the Truth never ceasing,<br>
To look for a star in the night,<br>
To knock at the door never tiring,<br>
To wait eagerly for his light.<br>

To walk hand in hand with each other,<br>
To share with the burdened their pain,<br>
To comfort the people who suffer,<br>
To help those in need, for no gain.<br>

To sense how oppressed are the poorest,<br>
To struggle for justice and right,<br>
To stand for the truth and be honest,<br>
To die to oneself in the fight.
