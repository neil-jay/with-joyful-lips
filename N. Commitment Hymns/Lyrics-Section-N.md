# N.1<span> FROM MY HEART BREAKS FORTH<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**From my heart breaks forth**<br>
**this lovely poem:**<br>
**My life entire, O Lord, is yours evermore.**<br>

From the gifts you shower upon me,<br>
I bring to you,<br>
O Lord, my life, my heart,<br> 
my whole being athirst for you.<br>

I thank you, O Father in heaven,<br>
for your care of me,<br>
For the faith, the love,<br>
the friendship received from you.<br>

I thank you, O Master of Life,<br>
you have made me for yourself,<br>
And my heart can have no<br>
repose till it rests in you.<br>

To you, O God of my youth,<br>
the of my way,<br>
I bring the love of my<br>
heart in joy unfeigned.<br>

Give thanks to the Father almighty,<br>
to Jesus Christ the Lord,<br>
To the Spirit who dwells in our hearts,<br>
through endless ages.<br>
<br>
# N.5<span> TAKE AND RECEIVE<br>

Take and receive, O Lord, my liberty,<br>
Take all my will, my mind, my memory,<br>
Do thou direct and govern all and sway,<br>
Do what thou wilt; command and I obey.<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Only thy grace and love on me bestow,**<br>
**Possessing these, all riches I forego.**<br>

All things I hold, and all I own, are thine;<br>
Thine was the gift, to thee I all resign.<br>
Do thou direct and govern all and sway,<br>
Do what thou wilt, command and I obey.<br>
<br>
# N.8<span> TAKE UP YOUR CROSS<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**If you wish to be my disciple,**<br>
**Take up your cross and follow me.**<br>

The foxes have their holes, the birds their nest,<br>
But I have not a place to take my rest.<br>

Whoever loves his life, will only lose it.<br>
It's only sacrifice that brings one gain.<br>

All you who labour, come you who are burdened.<br>
Take up my yoke as well and you'll find rest.<br>

The one who holds the plough and looks behind,<br>
My kingdom cannot serve, my peace won't find.<br>

A servant surely is less than his master:<br>
If they have hated me, they will hate you.<br>

Take nothing for your pay, no bread, no money.<br>
Your treasure must be one no moth destroys.<br>

So let your loins be girt, your lamps aburning.<br>
And be like those who wait for my return.<br>

You who have followed me, when life is ended,<br>
Will reap a hundredfold eternally.<br>
<br>
# N.9<span> GIVE ME JOY<br>

Give me joy in my heart, keep me praising,<br>
Give me joy in my heart, I pray.<br>

### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Sing hosanna, sing hosanna,**<br>
**Sing hosanna to the King of Kings!**<br>
**Sing hosanna, sing hosanna,**<br>
**sing hosanna to the King.**<br>

Give me oil in my lamp, keep me burning.<br>
Give me oil in my lamp, I pray.<br>
Give me oil in my lamp, keep me burning,<br>
Keep me burning till the end of day.<br>

Give me love in my work, keep me serving.<br>
Give me love in my work, I pray.<br>
Give me love in my work, keep me serving,<br>
Keep me serving till the end of day.<br>

Give me peace to my mind, keep be resting.<br>
Give me peace to my mind, I pray.<br>
Give me peace to my mind, keep be resting,<br>
Keep me resting till the end of day.<br>
<br>
# N.10<span> OH, THE LOVE OF MY LORD<br>

Oh, the love of my Lord is the essence<br>
Of all that I love here on earth.<br>
All the beauty I see he has given to me<br>
And his giving is gentle as silence.<br>

Every day, every hour, every moment<br>
Have been blessed by the strength of his love,<br>
At the turn of each tide, he is there at my side.<br>
And his touch is as gentle as silence.<br>

There've been times when<br>
I've turned from his presence<br>
And I've walked other paths, other ways.<br>
But I've called on his name<br>
in the dark of my shame.<br>
And his mercy was gentle as silence.<br>

So I will bless the  Lord who gives me counsel.<br>
And who directs my heart all through the night.<br>

**Yes, Lord, your will be done.**<br>
**You are our loving Father,**<br>
**You know what's best for every one.**<br>

When things are getting out of hand,<br>
When things don't go on as we planned,<br>
Then let us put our trust in you<br>
And let us say:<br>

Uncertainty is round the bend,<br>
The worst could substitute the best,<br>
Our rosy dreams are up in smoke.<br>
Then let us say:<br>

When those we loved and those who cared<br>
Are no more near us — they are dead,<br>
Our tear filled eyes are blind to see<br>
That you are there:<br>

And reveal to you my mind.<br>

I will take you from the nations<br>
And will bring you to your land.<br>
From your idols I will cleanse you<br>

He understands<br>
The joy and pain of life He too has known.<br>

Before you left your mother’s side<br>
I called to you, my child, to be my sign.<br>

I know that you are very young,<br>
But I will make you strong,<br>
I’ll fill you with my word;<br>
And you will travel through the land,<br>
Fulfilling my command which you have heard.<br>

And everywhere you are to go,<br>
My hand will follow you,<br>

In all the danger that you fear,<br>
You’ll find me very near, your words my own.<br>

With all my strength you will be filled:<br>
You will destroy and build:<br>
for that is my design.<br>
You will create and overthrow,<br>
Reap harvests I will sow:<br>
your word is mine.<br>

And the life I now live in the flesh,<br>
I live by faith in the Son of God<br>
Who loved me, who loved me<br>
And gave himself for me.<br>

Of the precious worth of knowing Christ...<br>

When I'm weak, I know I am strong in Him.<br>

Give them hearts for love alone.<br>

Each with a beauty all of its own.<br>

Some plant the seeds that others will water,<br>
But in all things God gives the growth,<br>
Come, let Him garden the flowers within you,<br>

**To want it to grow and increase.**<br>

To search for the Truth never ceasing,<br>
To look for a star in the night,<br>
To knock at the door never tiring,<br>
To wait eagerly for his light.<br>

To walk hand in hand with each other,<br>
To share with the burdened their pain,<br>
To comfort the people who suffer,<br>
To help those in need, for no gain.<br>

To sense how oppressed are the poorest,<br>
To struggle for justice and right,<br>
To stand for the truth and be honest,<br>
To die to oneself in the fight.<br>

**And send you in my name.**<br>

Tell them what I told to you,<br>
My words will be your own.<br>
They'll find me in the news you bring<br>
As you make my secrets known.<br>

Bring me all they have and need,<br>
Because my Father cares.<br>
Bring back his blessing and his peace<br>
And the food of life he shares.<br>

Be a shepherd to my flock<br>
And love as I have done.<br>
So they can see what "brother" ("sister") means<br>
And can feel that they are one.<br>

And may my feet walk in your way,<br>
Take my voice and let it sing a song of praise.<br>
From my lips may your word overflow.<br>

To you I bring my intellect and will.<br>
Lord, take my heart, make it your own,<br>
Take my energy, my silver and my gold.<br>
In exchange I will treasure your word.<br>

Lord, make my body a living sacrifice.<br>
Take and anoint it with your love.<br>
Let me worship you in spirit and in truth.<br>
By your touch may my life be renewed.<br>

Not of ourselves but the cross Christ endured.<br>
We're free from the law that said:<br>

And arrayed me in a robe of righteousness. (2)<br>

For He has sent me to heal the broken-hearted<br>
And proclaim to prisoners that they are free. (2)<br>

For God's own Spirit is poured upon his servant,<br>
He's anointed me with oil of gladness. (2)
