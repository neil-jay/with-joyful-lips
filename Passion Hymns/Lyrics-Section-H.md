H.1<br>
We hail thee, Saviour and Lord<br>
Thy cross ever be adored<br>

O Cross, thou art the fountain<br>
Of love and of liberty<br>
Shine down upon the millions<br>
Who search for the light of truth<br>

Look down upon the needy<br>
Confirm them in strength and grace<br>
Thou art our true salvation<br>
In thee, all our hope we place<br>

Be thou our sign of vict’ry<br>
Redeem us from sin and strife<br>
Renew  in us thy passion<br>
And grant us eternal life<br>
<br>
H.4<br>
O Cross, erected above the world<br>
Cross of our Saviour King (2)<br>
Fount from which gushed the waters<br>
Straight from the wound in his side<br>
Filling our lives with his gift of grace<br>
Cross of our Saviour King<br>

O Cross, sublime and refulgent tree<br>
Cross of our Saviour King<br>
Jesus, through thee, has he paid<br>
Thou art the folly of love divine<br>
Cross of our Saviour King<br>

O Cross, thou channel of grace divine<br>
Cross of our Saviour King (2)<br>
Tree on which death was conquered<br>
Thou the first altar of love<br>
Jesus the lamp gave his life on thee<br>
Cross of our Saviour King<br>

O Cross, all honour and praise to thee<br>
Cross of our Saviour King (2)<br>
Thou art the sign of Vict’ry<br>
Sign of redemption and life<br>
Homage and glory belong to thee<br>
Cross of our Saviour King<br>

H.11<br>
From the depths I call to you, O Lord<br>
Listen to my cry<br>

Lord, in compassion, listen to my pleading<br>
Listen, to my cry<br>
If you refuse, Lord, to forgive your people’s sins<br>
We would surely die<br>

So I am waiting, waiting for him patiently<br>
Hoping in his word<br>
More than the watchman waiting for the dawn to come<br>
I await the Lord<br>

So let us trust him for in him is mercy<br>
He, the Lord, is kind<br>
He gives us pardon, generous redemption<br>
Casts our sins behind.
