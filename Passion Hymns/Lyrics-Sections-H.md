H.1	We hail thee, Saviour and Lord
		Thy cross ever be adored
	1.	O Cross, thou art the fountain
		Of love and of liberty
		Shine down upon the millions
		Who search for the light of truth
	2.	Look down upon the needy
		Confirm them in strength and grace
		Thou art our true salvation
		In thee, all our hope we place
	3.	Be thou our sign of vict’ry
		Redeem us from sin and strife
		Renew  in us thy passion
		And grant us eternal life
H.4		O  Cross erected above the world
	1.	O Cross, erected above the world
		Cross of our Saviour King (2)
		Fount from which gushed the waters
		Straight from the wound in his side
		Filling our lives with his gift of grace
		Cross of our Saviour King 
	2.	O Cross, sublime and refulgent tree
		Cross of our Saviour King
		Jesus, through thee, has he paid
		Thou art the folly of love divine
		Cross of our Saviour King
	3.	O Cross, thou channel of grace divine
		Cross of our Saviour King (2)
		Tree on which death was conquered
		Thou the first altar of love
		Jesus the lamp gave his life on thee
		Cross of our Saviour King
	4.	O Cross, all honour and praise to thee
		Cross of our Saviour King (2)
		Thou art the sign of Vict’ry
		Sign of redemption and life
		Homage and glory belong to thee
		Cross of our Saviour King
H.11	From the depths I call to you, O Lord
		Listen to my cry
	1.	Lord, in compassion, listen to my pleading
		Listen, to my cry
		If you refuse, Lord, to forgive your people’s sins
		We would surely die
	2.	So I am waiting, waiting for him patiently
		Hoping in his word
		More than the watchman waiting for the dawn to come
		I await the Lord
	3.	So let us trust him for in him is mercy
		He, the Lord, is kind
		He gives us pardon, generous redemption
		Casts our sins behind
