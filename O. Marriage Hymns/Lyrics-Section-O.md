# O.1<span> PRAYER FOR OUR COUNTRY<br>

Where the mind is without  fear<br>
and the head is held high,<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Into that heaven of freedom, my Father,**<br>
**let my country awake!**<br>

Where knowledge is free,<br>

Where the world has not been broken up into<br>
fragments by narrow domestic walls,<br>

Where words come out from the depth of truth,<br>

Where tireless striving stretches<br>
its arms towards perfection,<br>

Where the clear stream of reason has not lost<br>
its way into the dreary desert sands of dead habit,<br>

Where the mind is led forward by thee<br>
into ever widening thought and action.<br>
<br>
# O.2<span> MAY THE GOD OF ISRAEL / Psalm 127<br>
### ***Chorus-1:***<br>
**May the God of Israel join in one;**<br>
**in joy and in sorrow, the Lord is your way.**<br>
### ***Chorus-2:***<br>
**Like olive branches around the table of the**<br>
**Lord, so God's children in the Church.**<br>

Blessed those who fear the Lord,<br>
who seek his path,<br>
For they shall find favour in his sight.<br>

Blessed be the toil of hands,<br>
they shall bear fruit;<br>
In joy and in gladness shall you work.<br>

With good fortune in your home shall you be blest;<br>
Your wife shall be like a fruitful vine.<br>

Blessed shall your children be around your board;<br>
Like strong olive branches shall they stand.<br>

Blest indeed shall be the ones who serve the Lord;<br>
For they shall prevail throughout their life.<br>

May the Lord who dwells on high give joy to you;<br>
And may he protect you all your life.<br>

May the sight of many children delight your heart;<br>
May God grant his peace to Israel.<br>
<br>
# O.3<span> MAY THE LORD PROTECT OUR HOMES / Psalm 126<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**May the Lord be our help and salvation.**<br>
**May the Lord protect and guard our homes.**<br>
**May he favour us with his blessings.**<br>
**May he keep us ever in his care.**<br>

If the house is not built by the Lord,<br>
In vain is the toil of the workers,<br>
If the town is not guarded by the Lord,<br>
In vain does the watchman keep all night vigil.<br>

In vain is your earlier rising,<br>
Your going later to rest,<br>
You who eat the bread of anxious toil,<br>
The Lord will provide for his friends<br>
while they slumber.<br>

Truly children are a gift from the Lord,<br>
A blessing, the fruit of the womb,<br>
For the sons born to man in his youth<br>
Are like arrows in the hand of a warrior.<br>

O happy is the man well provided,<br>
Who has filled his quiver with these arrows,<br>
He will have no cause for shame or worry<br>
When contending with his foes at the gateway.<br>

Give praise to the Father almighty<br>
To his Son Jesus Christ, the Lord,<br>
To the Spirit who dwells in our hearts,<br>
Both now and for ever. Amen.<br>
<br>
# O.5<span> ALL I ASK OF YOU<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**All I ask of you is forever**<br>
**to remember me as loving you.**<br>

Deep the joy of being together in one heart<br>
And for me that's just where it is.<br>

As we make our way through<br>
all the joys and pain,<br>
Can we sense our younger truer selves?<br>

Someone will be calling you<br>
to be there for a while.<br>
Can you hear his cry from deep within?<br>

Laughter, joy and presence:<br>
the only gifts you are!<br>
Have you time? I'd like to be with you.<br>

Persons come into the fibre of our lives<br>
And then their shadow fades and disappears,<br>
but...<br>
<br>
# O.8<span> CANTICLE OF LOVE<br>

My beloved is mine and I am his,<br>
See, he pastures his flock among the flowers.<br>
Let me see your face, let me hear your voice,<br>
As I sit in the shade of your love.<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**My beloved comes leaping**<br>
**o'er the mountains,**<br>
**My beloved comes bounding o'er the hills.**<br>
**Winter is over and the rains have gone,**<br>
**Flowers have appeared upon the earth.**<br>

You are comely, my love, and beautiful,<br>
You are fair and there is no flaw in you.<br>
You have ravished my heart with<br>
a glance of your eyes,<br>
How much better your love than wine!<br>

Let me be as a seal upon your arm,<br>
Set me there as a seal upon your heart.<br>
Though the waters should flood,<br>
love can never be drowned,<br>
How much stronger than death is love.<br>
<br>
# O.13<span> THAT THE WORLD MAY BELIEVE<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**That the world may believe (3)**<br>
**In the power of his love:**<br>
**We will walk side by side,**<br>
**we will walk hand in hand,**<br>
**We'll change the world**<br>
**through the power of our love!**<br>

My prayer, says the Lord, for these my own<br>
Is that they be of one heart and mind,<br>
Just as You are in me and I in You,<br>
May they be one in us that the world may believe.<br>

Wherever you go, there I shall go,<br>
And wherever you live, there shall I live<br>
I will love you and serve you for ever,<br>
For love is my decision today and every day.<br>

To dream our dream, to fight our foe<br>
And to bear unbearable woes,<br>
To forgive unforgivable hurts and wrongs,<br>
To love one another "as I have loved you".<br>
<br>
# O.16<span> LET THERE BE PEACE<br>

Let there be peace on earth and let it begin with me.<br>
Let there be peace on earth,<br>
the peace that was meant to be.<br>
With God as our Father, brothers and sisters are we.<br>
Let us all walk together in perfect harmony.<br>
Let peace begin with me,<br>
let this be the moment now<br>
With every step I take let this be my solemn vow:<br>
To take each moment and<br>
live each moment in peace eternally.<br>
Let there be peace on earth<br>
and let it begin with me!<br>
<br>
# O.18<span> SING TO THE BRIDE<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Sing to the bride, sing to the groom,**<br>
**For they love one another in Jesus, the Lord.**<br>
**Sing to the bride, sing to the groom,**<br>
**Sing to Jesus Christ!**<br>

Yahweh has brought you to the bone of your bone,<br>
Has joined you to the flesh of your flesh.<br>

You are the sign of the new Jerusalem,<br>
Come down out of heaven from our God.<br>

Love one another for love is of God,<br>
The person who loves is born of God.<br>

Faith, hope and love be with you unto the end,<br>
The greatest of these is surely love!<br>

Vain is your labour, all your planning, your dreams<br>
Unless the Lord build your home.<br>

May God protect you all the days of your life,<br>
May peace and prosperity be yours.
