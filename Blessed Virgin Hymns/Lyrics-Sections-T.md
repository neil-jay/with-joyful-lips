T.4		
All the bright morning stars
Sing together her praises
And are joined by the glorious dawn

Heavenly choirs of angels rejoice and give praise
As Mary the Virgin rises on high

I see her lovely as fiery dawn breaking forth
A glow like the sun resplendent above

See her ascend, a vapour of increase and myrrh
A Queen of the Heavens, close to her Son

O let all ages rise up in praise of your Son
Proclaiming his name as Jesus, the Lord

O Virgin Mary, Queen of all angels and men
O full of his grace, implore God for us

T.6
Ant.
You are the honour
You are the glory of our people
Holy Virgin Mary

You are the glory of Jerusalem
Holy Virgin Mary

You are the greatest joy of Israel
Holy Virgin Mary

You are the highest honour of our race
Holy Virgin Mary (Ant.)

May you be blest by the Lord most high
Holy Virgin Mary

Now and for all ages without end
Holy Virgin Mary

Give praise to God in the Church and Christ
Holy Virgin Mary (Ant.)
		
T.20
O maiden will you be the mother of the Saviour?
Your God has chosen you to give the world his Son
His power will be your shield, his Spirit come upon you
And Mary bowed and said: God’ will be done
And Mary said: Yes, and Mary said: Yes
And Mary said: Yes, when she knew that it was the will of God
No cradle will be his, but just a simple manger
A helpless little babe from Herod’s wrath he’ll run
And in a foreign land, long years he’ll have to linger
And Mary bowed and said: God’s will be done
And soon the day will come when enemies will round him
And nail him to a tree, your sinless, spotless one
The price of mankind’s ransom will heavy full upon him
And Mary bowed and said: God’s will be done
		
T.24	
Hail Holy Queen, Mother of Mercy
Hail our life, our sweetness and our hope
To you, do we cry Eve’s poor banished children
Mourning and weeping in this vale of tears
Turn then most gracious Advocate
Your eyes of mercy unto us
After our exile show to us
The fruit of your womb Jesus
O clement O loving O sweet Virgin Mary (2)
T.26
Hail, Mary, full of grace and mother of our God
O pray for us, poor sinners, Hail Mary full of grace
		
You heard the word of God and kept it in your heart
O bless’d among all women O Mary pray for us

You magnify the Lord and praise his holy name
The Lord, the mighty God, has one great thing for you

The Lord, the mighty God, has done great things for you

Your Son at your request, turned water into wine

You stood beside the cross unto the very last

Now show yourself to us as Mother of all mankind
T.29
Help me to live as your children
Give us your courage to say : Amen

When in the darkness we stumble
When we are lacking in faith

When we are hard-pressed with suffering
Love seems so far, far away

When life to us seems a burden
When all our work is in vain

Help us to live our commitment
Help us to answer God’s call

T.32
I will greatly rejoice in the Lord (2)
My soul shall exult, shall exult in my God
I will greatly rejoice in the Lord

For he has clothed me with the garment of salvation
He has covered me with the robe of righteousness
As a bridegroom decks himself with a garland
As a bride adorns herself with jewels

For as the earth brings forth its shoots
And as a garden causes what is sown in it to spring up
So the Lord will cause righteousness and praise
To spring forth before all the nations

T.34
Let’s sing to our Mother
As we would sing to our love
Mother in heaven, yet Mother with us on earth

Mary we love you, Mary we praise you
You are the joy of the earth
Angels revere you, Saints gather near you
Heaven rejoiced at your birth

Virgin most prudent, Daughter of Sion
Bright as the morning star
Fair as the moonbeams, Clear as the sunshine
Your splendour reaches afar

Fairest of creatures, Purest of virgins
You are our pride and our boast
Bringing the Saviour, Conquering evil
Guiding the sinner when lost

Child of the Father, Mother of Jesus
Bride of the Spirit of Love
Reigning triumphant, Leading your children
Home to heaven above

T.35
Holy Virgin, by God’s decree
You were called eternally
That He could give his Son to our race
Mary, we praise you hail full of grace
		
Ave, ave, ave Maria
By your faith and loving accord
As the handmaid of the Lord
Your undertook God’s plan to embrace
Mary, we thank you hail full of grace
Refuge for your children so weak
Sure protection all can seek
Problems of life you help us to face
Mary, we trust you, hail full of grace
To our needy world of today
Love and beauty you portray
Showing the path to Christ we must trace
Mary our mother, hail full of grace

T.37
Ave Maria, Mother of God’s son
Mother of our Saviour, Christ the Promised one....

When you came to Bethlehem
Shelter there was none
No one had a room to give
You and God’s own Son (2)

Every Christmas it’s his wish
To be born again
Not within a stable cold
But our human hearts (2)

We would like our hearts prepared
Help us Mother dear
May we really welcome Him
When He’s born this year (2)

T.44
O Virgin fair, star of the sea
My dearest mother, pray for me

O Lady, full of God’s own grace
Whose caring hands the child embraced
Who listened to the Spirit’s word
Believed and trusted in the Lord

O Lady, who felt daily joy
In caring for the holy boy
Whose home was plain and shorn of wealth
Yet was enriched by God’s own breath

O Lady, who bore living’s pain
But still believed that love would reign
Who on a hill watched Jesus die
As on the cross they raised Him high

O Lady, who on Easter day
Had all your sorrow wiped away
As God the Father’s will was done
When from death’s hold He freed your Son
		
T.45
My soul proclaims the Lord, my God
My spirit sings his praise
He looks on me, He lifts me up
And gladness fills my days

All nations now will share my joy
His gifts He has outpoured
His little ones He has made great
I magnify the Lord

His mercy is for evermore
His name I praise again
His strong right arm puts down the proud
And raises lowly ones

He fills the hungry with good things
The rich He sends away
The promise made to Abraham
Is filled by Him each day

T.46
Ave Maria, gratia plena
Dominus tecum, benedicta tu

As I kneel before you
As I bow my head in prayer
Take this day, make it yours
And fill me with your love

All I have I give you
Every dream and wish are yours
Mother of Christ, mother of mine
Present them to my Lord

As I kneel before you
And I see your smiling face
Every thought every word
Is lost in your embrace

T.53
I will magnify your name, O Lord, alleluia
I will drink of the well of your love, alleluia

I will worship you to the end of my days
With a heart that is full of praise

The Almighty has done marvels for me
Yes, his mercy endures from age to age

He has looked upon his humble maid
Generations all will call me blest

He has filled the poor, satisfied all their needs
And the rich empty handed send away

I will worship you to the end of my days
With a heart that is full of praise
