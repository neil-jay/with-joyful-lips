V.39<br>
Glory we sing to God on high<br>
Peace on earth to all his friends<br>
We thank, we praise, we worship him<br>
Lord God, our King and Father<br>

His only Son, Lord Jesus Christ<br>
Lord of all, the Lamb of God<br>
Who saves the world from all its sin<br>
To Him we  pray for mercy<br>

Glory to you, the Holy one<br>
Glory to you, the only Lord<br>
To God be glory, Christ most high<br>
The Spirit and the Father<br>
<br>
V.68<br>	
Glory, glory, glory to God in the highest<br>
And peace to his people on earth<br>

Our Lord and God and King of the heavens<br>
Mighty God and Father<br>
We worship and give thanks to you<br>
We praise you for your glory<br>

Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father<br>
Lamb of God, have mercy<br>
You free the world from sinfulness<br>
Have mercy, Lord have mercy<br>

Receive our prayer, O Son of the Father<br>
Hear our cry for mercy<br>
As from your seat at his right hand<br>
You share the throne of glory<br>

For you are Lord, the One and the holy<br>
With the Holy Spirit<br>
You are the only Lord most high<br>
In glory with the Father
