# M.2<span> BEND YOUR NECK TO MY YOKE / Psalm 33<br>
### ***Chorus-1:***<br>
**Bend your neck to my yoke,**<br>
**See how light is my burden:**<br>
**am meek and humble of heart.**<br>
### ***Chorus-2:***<br>
**O taste and see how good is the Lord!**<br>

I will bless the Lord with unending zeal,<br>
On my lips his praise shall resound for ever.<br>

In the Lord my God, I will make my boast<br>
And the poor will hear me with great rejoicing.<br>

Glorify the Lord, all with one accord,<br>
Let us praise his name with our hearts united.<br>

I have sought the Lord, he has answered me,<br>
He has set me free from all fears and dangers.<br>

Look in trust to him and be bright with joy<br>
Let no downcast looks ever cloud your faces.<br>

When the poor man cried, the Lord heard his call,<br>
Then he saved him from all distress and peril.<br>

O how good the Lord, only taste and see!<br>
He is blest, the one who in him takes refuge.<br>

Come and learn how wise is the fear of God,<br>
For his face indeed frowns on evil doers.<br>

**Who can tell the wonders of the Lord?**<br>
**Let us open our eyes, our ears and our hearts:**<br>
**It is Christ, our Lord, it is He!**<br>

In the stillness of the night,<br>
when the world was asleep,<br>
The Lord made his message known.<br>
It was then that his Word came down from on high,<br>
From the Father's royal throne:<br>
Christ, our Lord and our King!<br>

His mighty Word cuts quick and clean,<br>
Far sharper than a two-edged sword.<br>
Open your eyes, your ears and your hearts.<br>
And hear the Word of the Lord: Christ Our Lord...<br>

He came to his people, the chosen race,<br>
That his Father's will would be known.<br>
Lion of Judah, Light of the World,<br>
Our Redeemer came to his own: Christ...<br>

He is the plan of God, He is the Mystery,<br>
In Him we live and move and have our being.<br>

His yoke is easy, his burden light.<br>

In Him is victory, in Him redemption,<br>
In Him salvation, He sets us free.<br>

# M.23<span> SING LIFE, SING LOVE, SING JESUS<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Sing life, sing love sing Jesus,**<br>
**Sing out whoever you are. (2)**<br>

Life is around us to use or abuse.<br>
Life in the great or the small.<br>
Each one of us has the power to choose,<br>
Whether to notice or just ignore life’s call.<br>

Love is around us to take and to give,<br>
Love bringing life to us all.<br>
Each one of us in the way that we live<br>
Shows that we notice or just ignore love’s call.<br>

Jesus loved life, but for love Jesus died,<br>
Jesus the truth and the way.<br>
Though life was lost and the truth was denied,<br>
Love lives again as we greet the Lord’s new day.<br>
<br>
# M.24<span> WONDERFUL LOVE<br>

And right on through the day,<br>
Each step you take, each move you make<br>
Just speaks of love, his love so wonderful!<br>

His love is not to imprison,<br>
it cannot stay within;<br>
To all your friends you have been sent<br>
To show them that his love is wonderful!<br>

No words can tell what his love is,<br>
No mind can comprehend,<br>
No power on earth can bring to birth<br>
The mystery of his love so wonderful!<br>
<br>
# M.25<span> IF YOU REALLY LOVE JESUS<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**If you really love Jesus,**<br>
**you will do his will,**<br>
**To his word if you will listen,**<br>
**be quiet and still.**<br>

He asks you to be helpful<br>
to all those in need,<br>
He asks you to be caring for the sick<br>
and the weak.<br>

He asks you to be loving<br>
both to friend and to foe,<br>
He asks you to be helpful with a Yes<br>
and ne'er a No.<br>

He asks you to be patient,<br>
to be generous, to be mild,<br>
"You will not see my kingdom<br>
if you don't remain a child".<br>
<br>

Glorious Father of such perfect love,<br>
Given by Jesus your Son,<br>
Brought by your Spirit and healing us now,<br>
Praise be to God, three in one.<br>

In your loving care, Lord, we feel secure.<br>

The Word who is life,<br>
this we share with you.<br>

all evil and strife!<br>
<br>
# M.32<span> WHO SHALL SEPARATE US?<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Who shall separate us**<br>
**from the love of Christ? (2)**<br>

For tribulation, danger or distress,<br>
Cannot make us love him less.<br>

And in the face of peril or the sword<br>
We'll affirm that he is Lord.<br>

Though we be persecuted for his sake,<br>
There's no doubt his cross we'll take.<br>

For Jesus is our Shepherd, he's our friend,<br>
We shall love him to the end.<br>

And in the fight for justice we shall stand,<br>
Knowing well he'll hold our hand.<br>

For Christ has truly risen as he said.<br>
Jesus is no longer dead.<br>
