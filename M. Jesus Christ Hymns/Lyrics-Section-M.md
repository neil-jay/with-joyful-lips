M.5	Sing my tongue<br>

Let all bow in adoration<br>
To this Sacrament so great<br>
Here is new and perfect worship<br>
All the old must terminate<br>
Senses cannot grasp this marvel<br>
Faith must serve to compensate<br>

Glory, honour adoration<br>
Let us sing with one accord<br>
Praised be God, almighty Father<br>
Praised be Christ, his Son, our Lord<br>
Praised be God, the Holy Spirit<br>
Triune Godhead be adored, Amen<br>
<br>
M.13<br>
Jesus meek and humble of heart<br>
Make my heart like yours<br>

Come in me, you who are heavily laden<br>
And I will give you rest<br>
Take my yoke and learn from me<br>
I am meek and humble of heart<br>

Come to me, you who are thirsting for water<br>
And I will give you drink<br>
Come and stay beneath my cross<br>
From my heart flow living streams<br>

Follow me! Why do you walk in the darkness<br>
When I’m the light of life?<br>
Come where my Father dwells<br>
I’m the Way, the Truth and the Life<br>
<br>
M.15<br>
Jesus, you are my salvation<br>
Jesus, you’re my inspiration<br>
Jesus, you’re the treasure of my life<br>

Jesus, you offer new sight to the blind<br>
Healing the crippled, the deaf and the mute<br>
Cleansing the leper and banishing ills<br>
Raising the dead to life<br>

Jesus, you nurture the hungry with bread<br>
Stilling the tempest and calming the sea<br>
Turning life’s water to glittering wine<br>
Shedding your blood for me<br>

Jesus, my refuge, in you do I trust<br>
Jesus, my Saviour, in you I rejoice<br>
Jesus, my way and my truth and my life<br>
Jesus who sets me free<br>

Jesus, the wisdom and power of the Lord<br>
Jesus, our high priest, our passover Lamb<br>
Jesus, the brightness and image of God<br>
Jesus, the King of peace<br>
<br>
M.23<br>
Sing life, sing love sing Jesus<br>
Sing out whoever you are (2)<br>

Life is around us to use or abuse<br>
Life in the great or the small<br>
Each one of us has the power to choose<br>
Whether to notice or just ignore life’s call<br>

Love is around us to take and to give<br>
Love bringing life to us all<br>
Each one of us in the way that we live<br>
Shows that we notice or just ignore love’s call<br>

Jesus loved life, but for love Jesus died<br>
Jesus the truth and the way<br>
Though life was lost and the truth was denied<br>
Love lives again as we greet the Lord’s new day<br>
<br>
M.26<br>
Jesus the healer<br>
Jesus the healer healer is here in our midst<br>
As he has promised to be<br>
Standing among us with arms open wide<br>
Giving his love so free<br>
Who could refuse such tender love<br>
Where is the person so whole?<br>
Come all you sick, come all you troubled<br>
Let Jesus enter your soul<br>

We are all fraught by the cares of the world<br>
Tension and turmoil and din<br>
Now let us rest in his glorious love<br>
Quietly listen to Him<br>

We can rely on the power of his love<br>
Brought by his Spirit divine<br>
Cleansing from sins and thus making us whole<br>
Jesus, all glory is Thine<br>

Glorious Father of such perfect love<br>
Given by Jesus your Son<br>
Brought by your Spirit and healing us now<br>
Praise be to God, three in one<br>
<br>
M.40<br>
God’s love is so wonderful<br>
Jesus is so wonderful<br>
God’s love is so wonderful<br>
So wonderful for you and for me<br>

God is always kind when you’re lonely<br>
Keep him closer to your heart<br>
He will give you peace, He will give you rest<br>
If you have his love in your heart<br>

Put your trust in God, everybody<br>
Every day and every hour<br>
He will give you joy, He will give you hope<br>
If you have his love in your heart<br>

God will never fail if you ask<br>
Always share his love for us<br>
Praise Him with your song, praise Him with your harp<br>
Let the whole world know his love for us.
