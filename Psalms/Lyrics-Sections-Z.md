Z.1<br>
How blessed are the ones who never walk<br>
Within the place where wicked scoffers talk.<br> 
We’re like a tree that’s planted by the water:<br>
We shall not be moved !<br>
We shall not be, we shall not be moved ! (2)<br>
We’re like a tree that’s planted by the water:<br>
We shall not be moved.<br>

Our joy is in the statutes of the Lord,<br>
And night and day we ponder on the Word.<br>

The wicked shall not stand the judgment day,<br>
But like the chaff they'll all be blown away.<br>

Sing glory be to God the Father, Son,<br>
And Holy Spirit, ever three in one.<br>
<br>
ZZ.1<br>

BLEST ARE THEY WHO DELIGHT<br> 

Blest are they who delight in the law of the Lord.<br>

Happy indeed are the ones<br>
Who follow not the counsel of the wicked.<br>
nor linger in the way of sinners,<br>
nor sit in the company of scorners,<br>
But who delight in the law of the Lord<br>
and who ponder his law day and night.<br>

They are like trees that are planted<br>
beside the flowing waters,<br>
 that yield their fruits in due season<br> 
and whose leaves shall never fade:<br>
and all that they do shall prosper.<br>
Not so are the wicked, not so!<br>

For they like winnowed chaff,<br> 
shall be driven away by the wind.<br> 
When the wicked are judged, they shall not stand.<br>
nor find room among those who are just.<br>
for the Lord guards the way of the just,<br>
but the way of the wicked leads to doom.<br>

Give praise to the Father almighty,<br>
to his Son, Jesus Christ the Lord,<br>
to the Spirit who dwells in our hearts,<br> 
both now and for ever. Amen.<br>

Great is your name, Lord, Its majesty fills the earth.<br>

When I see the heavens, the work of your hands,<br> 
The moon and the stars which you arranged,<br>
What is man that you should keep him in mind,<br>
Mortal man that you care for him?<br>

Yet you have made him little less than a god,<br>
With glory and honour you crowned him.<br>
Gave him power over the works of your hand,<br> 
Put all things under his feet.<br>

Give glory to the Father almighty.<br>
To his Son, Jesus Christ, the Lord,<br>
To the Spirit who dwells in our hearts,<br> 
Both now and for ever Amen.<br>

The butt of all, laughing-stock of the people.<br>
All who see me deride me,<br>
They curl their lips, they toss their heads;<br>
“He trusted in the Lord, let him save him<br>
Let him release him if this is his friend.”<br>

I can count every one of my bones.<br>
These people stare at me and gloat;<br>
They divide my clothing among them.<br>
They cast lots for my robe.<br>

O Lord, do not leave me alone,<br>
My strength, make haste to help me.<br> 
Rescue my soul from the sword,<br>
My life from the grip of these dogs.<br> 
Save my life from the jaws of these lions.<br> 
My poor soul from the horns of the oxen.<br>

If I should walk in the valley of darkness, No evil would I fear,<br>
You are there with your crook and your staff, With these you give me comfort.<br>

You have prepared a banquet for me, In the sight of my foes.<br>
My head you have anointed with oil; My cup is overflowing.<br>

Surely goodness and kindness shall follow me.<br>
All the days of my life. In the Lord’s own house shall I dwell For ever and ever.<br>

O Lord, hear my voice when I call, have mercy and answer.<br>
Of you my heart has spoken, “Seek his face”.<br>

The Lord loves justice and right, and fills the earth with his love.<br>

By his word the heavens were made, by the breath of his mouth all the stars,<br>
He collects the waves of the ocean, he stores up the depths of the sea.<br>

Let all the earth fear the Lord, all who live in the world revere him.<br>
He spoke; and it came to be. He commanded; it sprang into being.<br>

He frustrates the designs of the nations, he defeats the plans of the peoples.<br>
His own designs shall stand for ever. The plans of his heart from age to age.<br>

From the place where he dwells, he gazes on all the dwellers on the earth,<br>
he who shapes the hearts of them all, who considers all their deeds.<br>

A king is not saved by his army. Nor a warrior preserved by his strength.<br>
A vain hope for safety is the horse; despite its power it cannot save.<br>

The Lord looks on those who revere him, on those who hope in his love,<br>
to rescue their souls from death, to keep them alive in famine.<br>

Our soul is waiting for the Lord. The Lord is our help and our shield.<br>
In him do our hearts find joy. We trust in his holy name.<br>

To the Father, the Son and Holy Spirit give praise for ever. Amen.<br>

Here was a poor wretch who cried to the Lord,<br>
He heard him and saved him from his troubles.<br>
The angel of the Lord is on guard Round those<br>
who fear Him and rescues them.<br>

Fear the Lord, all you his holy peoples,<br>
For those who fear Him, lack nothing.<br>

bless his holy name. My soul,<br>
give thanks to the Lord and never<br> 
forget all his blessings.<br>

It is he who forgives all your guilt,<br>
who heals every one of your ills,<br>
who redeems your life from the grave,<br>
who crowns you with love and compassion.<br>

Who fills your life with good things,<br>
renewing your youth like an eagle’s<br>
The Lord does deeds of Justice.<br>
Gives judgement for all who are oppressed.<br>

He made known his ways to Moses<br>
and his deeds to Israel’s sons.<br>
The Lord is compassion and love,<br>
slow to anger and rich in mercy.<br>

His wrath will come to an end,<br>

so far does he remove our sins.<br>

As a father has compassion on his children,<br>
the Lord has pity on those who fear him.<br>
For he knows of what we are made,<br>
he remembers that we are dust.<br>

As for us, our days are like grass,<br>
we flower like the flower of the field;<br>
One gust of wind, and we are gone<br>
and our place never sees us again.<br>

But the love of the Lord is everlasting<br>
upon those who hold him in fear;<br>
and age after age he will do justice<br>
to those who keep his covenant in truth.<br>

On our lips there were songs.<br>

The heathens themselves said:<br>
“What marvels The Lord worked for them<br>
What marvels the Lord worked for us!<br>
Indeed we were glad!<br>

Deliver us, O Lord, from our bondage,<br> 
As streams in dry land.<br>
Those who are sowing in tears<br> 
Will sing as they reap.<br>

They go out, they go out, full of tears,<br> 
Carrying the seed for the sowing;<br>
They come back, they come back, full of song.<br> 
Carrying their sheaves.<br>

From afar, he marks down the proud.<br>
Though I live in the midst of affliction,<br> 
my life he preserves against my foes.<br>
