Lift your eyes to the hill.<br>
Seek the Saviour until he appears.<br>
It is God who comes to our aid,<br>
God incarnate our ransom has paid.<br>

From the Lord comes release,<br>
He makes evil to cease all around,<br>
Night and day he guards us from harm;<br>
We depend on the strength of his arm.<br>

Come Redeemer and Lord,<br>
Spread thy peace and concord on the earth.<br>
For thy second coming we yearn;<br>
From our bondage of sin we will turn.<br>

Render thanks and bless him in song<br>
To him glory and honour belong.<br>

# E.5<span> REJOICE, ISRAEL / Psalm 79<br>
### ***Chorus-1:***<br>
**Rejoice, Israel: behold your Saviour comes!**<br>
### ***Chorus-2:***<br>
**Of a Virgin shall He be born, Emmanuel.**<br>

Shepherd of Israel, listen to our plea,<br>
You who lead your people to the pasture.<br>

You who are seated above the Cherubim,<br>
Rouse your strength and come to save your people.<br>

Will you in anger still turn away from us?<br>
Will you spurn the pleadings of your people?<br>

Long have we eaten the tasteless bread of tears,<br>
You have made us drink the gall of bitterness.<br>

See how our neighbours now look on us with scorn<br>
And with railing laughter they deride us.<br>

O Lord most powerful, O Saviour, come to us,<br>
In your mercy deal with us with tenderness.<br>

You brought a vine out of Egypt long ago<br>
And to plant it drove out the nations.<br>

Its branches spread to the river all the way,<br>
Reaching every corner of the Kingdom.<br>

Why then, O Lord, should its walls now be destroyed<br>
So that its fruit can be plucked by the passers by?<br>

O Lord most powerful, O come and save your vine,<br>
Let it feel the greatness of your mighty power.<br>

Never more, Inrd, shall we from your care depart,<br>
We will sing your praises and your glory.<br>
<br>

The Spirit and the Bride say: 'Come',<br>
Let those who hear their voices say 'Come'.<br>

Those who have thirst,<br>
let them come and those who have desire,<br>
Let them drink the waters of everlasting life.<br>

"Yes, I come very soon!" Amen!<br>
Come, O Lord Jesus!<br>
<br>

**May your glory shine on the earth,**<br>
**Pour on us the grace that shall save.**<br>

What blessings, Lord,<br>
you gave to this land of yours,<br>
Restoring Jacob's fortunes again.<br>
You overlooked the guilt of your people;<br>
You covered all their sins and forgave.<br>

You calmed, O Lord, the heat of your anger;<br>
Revive us now, O God of our help;<br>
Will you prolong your grievance for ever?<br>
Against us will your wrath never cease?<br>

Your promise now fulfil; bring us back to life<br>
And let your people glory in you.<br>
O Lord, reveal your love and your mercy<br>
And to your people grant saving help.<br>

I'll listen to the voice of the Lord, my God.<br>
A voice that speaks a message of peace.<br>
His saving help is near to those fearing him,<br>
His glory in our land finds a home.<br>

See, faithfulness and love meet together<br>
And righteousness and peace now embrace.<br>
Soon faithfulness shall spring from the earth below,<br>
And justice will look down from the sky.<br>

The Lord himself will grant us his blessing,<br>
Our land will yield its harvest in full.<br>
Before the Lord shall justice for ever walk,<br>
The earth's salvation follow his steps.<br>

Closer than the air we breathe is our risen King.<br>

The deafened ears have been unsealed,<br>
The lame have leapt and sung for joy.<br>

"Forgive", he says, "all those who hurt you,<br>
Love instead as God's good children should,<br>
Don't be their judge lest you be judged,<br>
As God alone can judge us all."<br>

He will judge in righteousness.<br>
And he will crush, put down oppressors,<br>
Give deliverance to the weak.<br>

He falls like dew upon the flowers,<br>
Like the rains that quench the earth.<br>
And in his days, justice shall flourish,<br>
He will be the Prince of peace.<br>

May Jesus rule o'er land and ocean,<br>
May his foes before Him bow.<br>
Long may He live, His name enduring,<br>
May all people bless His name.<br>
