Bestir thy power and come Lord<br> 
To save our sin-laden race<br>
Reveal thy bounty and goodness<br>
Diffuse thy splendour and grace<br>

Lift your eyes to the hill<br>
Seek the Saviour until he appears<br>
It is God who comes to our aid<br>
God incarnate our ransom has paid<br>

From the Lord comes release<br>
He makes evil to cease all around<br>
Night and day he guards us from harm<br>
We depend on the strength of his arm<br>

Come Redeemer and Lord<br>
Spread thy peace and concord on the earth<br>
For thy second coming we yearn<br>
From our bondage of sin we will turn<br>

To our God let us raise<br>
Our glad voices in praise and esteem<br>
Render thanks and bless him in song<br>
To him glory and honour belong<br>
<br>
E.6<br>
Maranatha! Come, O Christ the Lord<br>

I am the Root of Jesse and David’s Son<br>
The radiant Star of morning and God’s own Light<br>
    
The Spirit and the Bride say 'Come' <br>
Let those who hear their voices say 'Come' <br>

Those who have thirst, let them come and those who have desire<br>
Let them drink the waters of everlasting life<br>

Yes, I come very soon! Amen!<br>
Come, O Lord Jesus!<br>
<br>
E.14<br>
Come, quickly, Lord<br>

Promised Lord and Christ is He<br>
May we soon his Kingdom see<br>
Come, O Lord, quickly come<br>
Come in glory, come in glory<br>
Come in glory, come in glory<br>
Come in glory, quickly come<br>

Teaching healing once was He<br>

Dead and buried once was He<br>

Risen from the dead is He<br>

Soon to come again is He<br>
May we soon his Kingdom see<br>
Come, O Lord, quickly come<br>
In our life-time, in our life-time<br>
In our life-time may it be<br>
<br>
E.16<br>
Comfort, comfort my people<br>
Says the Lord, your God<br>
Cry out loud to Jerusalem<br>
God has pardoned you<br>

Every valley shall be filled<br>
Every mount and hell made low<br>

In the desert, make a path<br>
For the Lord, Emmanuel<br>

For the glory of the Lord<br>
Soon shall be revealed to me<br>
<br>
E.18<br>
Jesus, Come, Jesus, come, Jesus, come<br>
Say to us: I’m the one who is to come<br>

He will come just when you feel<br>
He’ll never come<br>
He will come just when you think<br>
He is gone<br>
He’ll be there just when you find<br>
He’s elsewhere<br>
Please don’t be late, be awake, let Him come<br>

He will come just when you want to shut your door<br>
He will come just when you want to be alone<br>
He’ll be there just when you are not aware<br>
Don’t make Him wait, be alert, let Him come<br>

He will come to share his Love, Peace and Joy<br>
He will come to save us all from sin<br>
He’ll be there to lift us up when we fall<br>
He’s knocking hard, open wide, let Him come<br>
<br>
E.19<br>
Wake up, O people, the Lord is very near<br>
Wake up and stand for the Lord (2)<br>

Your saving Lord is near, Wake Up<br>
His glory will appear, Wake up<br>
Your hour of grace is nearer than it ever was<br>

The night of sin has past, Wake up<br>
The light is near at last, Wake up<br>
The Day Star, Christ, the Son of God will soon appear<br>

To live in love and peace, Wake up<br>
To let all quarrels cease, Wake up<br>
To live that all you do may stand the light of day…<br>

That Christ may be your shield, Wake up<br>
That death to life may yield, Wake up<br>
That heaven’s gate be opened wide again for you….<br>
<br>

The Savior is waiting to enter your heart<br>
Why don't you let Him come in<br>
There's nothing in this world to keep you apart<br>
What is your answer to Him<br>

Time after time, He has waited before<br>
And now He is waiting again<br>
To see if you're willing to open the door<br>
Oh, how He wants to come in<br>
If you'll take one step toward the Savior, my friend<br>
You'll find His arms open wide<br>
Receive Him and all of your darkness will end<br>
With in your heart He'll abide
