L.26
My God, only source of my joy
For you are my God, only source of my joy
You keep me, O God, for cling unto you
And defend me from all harm

The faithful who dwell in the land
Give me happiness
And those who accept alien gods
I’ll never speak of them

Yes, Lord, you’re my portion and cup
You I claim for my prize
It’s you who keep filling my cup
Assure my inheritance

So I praise the Lord for his works
He instructs my soul
The Lord is my stronghold and might
I shall stand firm with him          

L.27
May you be blest, O God of love
May you be blest for Jesus Christ!

May you be blest for your return!

God of peace (2) blessed are you (2)
God of Joy (2), blessed are you (2)
God of life (2), blessed are you (2)
God who cares (2), blessed are you (2)

God hope…. God made man…..
God with us… God of all…..

Suffering Lord… Wounded Lord…
Dying Lord…. Risen Lord….

L.28
Then sings my soul
Oh, Lord my God, when I, in awesome wonder
Consider all the world thy hand has made
I see the stars, I hear the mighty thunder
Thy power throughout the universe displayed
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to  Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art (2)

And when I think that God, his Son not sparing
Sent Him to earth, I scarcely can believe
That on the cross, our burden gladly bearing
He gave his life for all the world’s relief

And when draws near the day of my salvation
What happiness, what joy shall fill my heart
When I shall bow in humble adoration
And then proclaim, my God, how great thou art

L.29
Spirit of joy, exceeding all joys,
Fill every heart
Through all creation spread your delight
Joy of the Lord on earth

Galaxies as you race through space
Speed along to the song of creation
Gentle star as you join in the chase
Add your notes of jubilation
Joy, joy, unspeakable joy, joy, God’s own bliss
Joy of creation, God’s own joy on earth!

Young folk with your vision rejoice
Older folk, dream dreams of joy
Tender babes, bring joy to your homes
As the earth is filled with children
Joy, joy unspeakable joy, joy, poured on us!
Joy of creation, God’s own joy earth

Pure of heart, rejoice with your Maker
Let your works like his be pure
May your joy be found in creating
As you work from hour to hour
Joy, Joy, unspeakable joy, joy, of the Just
Joy of creation, God’s own joy on earth 

L.31
The heavens declare the glory of God
The glory of God, alleluia!
The heavens proclaim his handwork
And day and night sing his praise

There is no speech nor are there words
Their voice is not heard
Yet they tell his glorious deeds
Through all the earth

God’s glory thunders loud over all
He sits enthroned
Over all the floods and seas
As king evermore

Give the Lord, sons of God
The glory that’s due
To the most High, wonderful name
And he’ll give us peace

L.36
We believe

We believe in God the Father
We believe, we believe
We believe, He to the Holy one
We believe, we believe

We believe in Jesus Christ the Lord, We believe…
We believe He is God’s only Son, We believe…

He was conceived by the Holy Spirit
Born of the Virgin Mary
For us He died and was buried
On the third day He rose again

We believe in the Holy Spirit, We believe….
We believe in the Holy Church of God, We believe…

We believe in God’s forgiveness
The resurrection from the dead
We believe in life everlasting
We believe, we believe, Amen
We believe, Amen we believe

L.37
God still loves the world

Every tiny star that twinkles in the night sky
Every drop of morning dew
Every spark of fire blazing in the furnace
Every captivating view
Every rainbow in the sky, every pretty butterfly
Tells the fascinating news to those who dare to hope
And the message is :
God still loves the world!
God still, still loves the world
So throw your life into his hands
Day by day discern his plans
God is passionately busy loving you and me

Every ocean wave that breaks upon the sea shore
Every stalk of golden wheat
Every silver stream that gushes down the mountain
Every drop of honey sweet
Every eagle flying high every worm that wriggles by…
Tells the fascinating news to those who dare to hope
And the message is :
God stil…

Every man and woman pledged in love forever
Every little new born child
Every voice in favour of a needy neighbour
Every radiating smile
Every hand that offers love, every surging flow of blood…	

L.40
Father we love you

Father we love you, we worship and adore you
Glorify your name in all the earth
Glorify your name, glorify your name
Glorify your name in all the earth

Jesus….
