Do what thou wilt, command and I obey<br>

The joy and pain of life He too has known<br>

Oh the word of my Lord, deep within my being<br>
Oh the word of my Lord, you have filled my mind<br>

I knew you through and through, I chose you to be mine<br>
Before you left your mother’s side<br>
I called to you my child, to be my sign<br>

I know that you are very young<br>
But I will make you strong, I’ll fill you with my word<br>
And you will travel through the land<br>
Fulfilling my command which you have heard<br>

And everywhere you are to go<br>
My hand will follow you, you will not be alone<br>
In all the danger that you fear<br>
You’ll find me very near, your words my own<br>

You will find your way, Bloom, bloom, bloom<br>
You will have your day<br>

Look at the flowers, look at them growing<br>
They never worry, they never work<br>
Yet look at the way our Father clothes them<br>
Each with a beauty all of its own<br>

Some plant the seeds that others will water<br>
But in all things God gives the growth<br>
Come, let Him garden the flowers within you<br>
Come and discover some you’ve never known<br>

Look at the love that lies deep within you<br>
Let yourself be Let yourself be<br>
Look at the gifts you have been given<br>
Let them go free Let them go free<br>

To love as He loved and bring peace<br>
To spend our lifetime for his kingdom<br>
To want it to grow and increase<br>

To look for a star in the night<br>
To knock at the door never tiring<br>
To want it to grow and increase<br>

To share with burdened their pain<br>
To comfort the people who suffer<br>
To help those in need, for no gain<br>

To sense how oppressed are the poorest<br>
To struggle for justice and right<br>
To stand for the truth and be honest<br>
To die to oneself in the fight.
