Deep calls to deep

Deep calls to deep
And my soul finds no resting place but him
He is my God
The yearnings of my heart his touch can still
And each rare moment that I’ve felt his presence
I shall remember and forever cherish

Deep calls to deep
And at his feast I am a welcome guest
He gives me food
The hunger of my soul is laid to rest
And each….

Deep calls to deep
For He created me to be his own
He understands
The joy and pain of life He too has known
And each….

Oh the word of my Lord, deep within my being
Oh the word of my Lord, you have filled my mind

Before I formed you in the womb
I knew you through and through, I chose you to be mine
Before you left your mother’s side
I called to you my child, to be my sign

I know that you are very young
But I will make you strong, I’ll fill you with my word
And you will travel through the land
Fulfilling my command which you have heard

And everywhere you are to go
My hand will follow you, you will not be alone
In all the danger that you fear
You’ll find me very near, your words my own

With all my strength you will be filled
You will destroy and build for that is my design
You will create and overthrow
Reap harvests I will sow: your word is mine

Here I am Lord, is it I Lord?
I have heard you calling in the night
I will go, Lord, if you lead me
I will hold your people in my heart

I, the Lord of sea and sky, I have heard my people cry
All who dwell in dark and sin, my hand will save
I who made the stars of night
I will make their darkness bright
Who will bear my light to them? Whom shall I send?

I, the Lord of snow and rain, I have borne my people’s pain
I have break their hearts of stone
Give them hearts for love alone
I will speak my word to them, Whom shall I send?

I will set a feast for them, my hand will save
Finest bread I will provide
Till their hearts be satisfied

You will find your way, Bloom, bloom, bloom
You will have your day

They never worry, they never work
Yet look at the way our Father clothes them
Each with a beauty all of its own

Some plant the seeds that others will water
But in all things God gives the growth
Come, let Him garden the flowers within you
Come and discover some you’ve never known

Look at the love that lies deep within you
Let yourself be Let yourself be
Look at the gifts you have been given
Let them go free Let them go free

To follow the Lord and find freedom
To love as He loved and bring peace
To spend our lifetime for his kingdom
To want it to grow and increase

To search for the Truth never ceasing
To look for a star in the night
To knock at the door never tiring
To want it to grow and increase

To walk hand in hand with each other
To share with burdened their pain
To comfort the people who suffer
To help those in need, for no gain

To sense how oppressed are the poorest
To struggle for justice and right
To stand for the truth and be honest
To die to oneself in the fight.
