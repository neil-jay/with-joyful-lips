E.	The Savior is waiting to enter your heart
Why don't you let Him come in
There's nothing in this world to keep you apart
What is your answer to Him

Time after time, He has waited before
And now He is waiting again
To see if you're willing to open the door
Oh, how He wants to come in
	If you'll take one step toward the Savior, my friend
You'll find His arms open wide
Receive Him and all of your darkness will end
With in your heart He'll abide
