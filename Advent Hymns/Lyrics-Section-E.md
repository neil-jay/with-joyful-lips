Bestir thy power and come Lord
To save our sin-laden race
Reveal thy bounty and goodness
Diffuse thy splendour and grace

Lift your eyes to the hill
Seek the Saviour until he appears
It is God who comes to our aid
God incarnate our ransom has paid

From the Lord comes release
He makes evil to cease all around
Night and day he guards us from harm
We depend on the strength of his arm

Come Redeemer and Lord
Spread thy peace and concord on the earth
For thy second coming we yearn
From our bondage of sin we will turn

To our God let us raise
Our glad voices in praise and esteem
Render thanks and bless him in song
To him glory and honour belong

E.6
Maranatha! Come, O Christ the Lord

I am the Root of Jesse and David’s Son
The radiant Star of morning and God’s own Light

The Spirit and the Bride say `Come’
Let those who hear their voices say `Come’

Those who have thirst, let them come and those who have desire
Let them drink the waters of everlasting life

Yes, I come very soon! Amen!
Come, O Lord Jesus!

E.14
Come, quickly, Lord

Promised Lord and Christ is He
May we soon his Kingdom see
Come, O Lord, quickly come
Come in glory, come in glory
Come in glory, come in glory
Come in glory, quickly come

Teaching healing once was He

Dead and buried once was He

Risen from the dead is He

Soon to come again is He
May we soon his Kingdom see
Come, O Lord, quickly come
In our life-time, in our life-time
In our life-time may it be

E.16
Comfort, comfort my people
Says the Lord, your God
Cry out loud to Jerusalem
God has pardoned you

Every valley shall be filled
Every mount and hell made low

In the desert, make a path
For the Lord, Emmanuel

For the glory of the Lord
Soon shall be revealed to me

E.18
Jesus, Come, Jesus, come, Jesus, come
Say to us: I’m the one who is to come

He will come just when you feel
He’ll never come
He will come just when you think
He is gone
He’ll be there just when you find
He’s elsewhere
Please don’t be late, be awake, let Him come

He will come just when you want to shut your door
He will come just when you want to be alone
He’ll be there just when you are not aware
Don’t make Him wait, be alert, let Him come

He will come to share his Love, Peace and Joy
He will come to save us all from sin
He’ll be there to lift us up when we fall
He’s knocking hard, open wide, let Him come

E.19
Wake up, O people, the Lord is very near
Wake up and stand for the Lord (2)

Your saving Lord is near, Wake Up
His glory will appear, Wake up
Your hour of grace is nearer than it ever was

The night of sin has past, Wake up
The light is near at last, Wake up
The Day Star, Christ, the Son of God will soon appear

To live in love and peace, Wake up
To let all quarrels cease, Wake up
To live that all you do may stand the light of day…

That Christ may be your shield, Wake up
That death to life may yield, Wake up
That heaven’s gate be opened wide again for you….

E.24
HOPE, SWEET HOPE OF ALL AGES
Hope, sweet hope of all ages: Jesus Christ! 
Hope, sweet hope of all peoples: Jesus Christ!

Come to our aid today and always: Jesus Christ! 
Strengthen our weakened faith when It sways: J.C.

Your love alone is love that saves: Jesus Christ! 
For love and peace the human heart craves: J.C.

Like heavenly rain that sinks into earth: J.C. 
Pour down your love and bring it to birth: J.C.

Glory of God and peace to all nations: J.C. 
Love crucified to win us salvation: J.C.

E.25
COME, EMMANUEL, COME 

Come Emmanuel, come to save your people. 
Come Emmanuel, come delay no more.

Come. 0 David's Son...

Come, 0 Rising Sun...

Come, desire of the world...

Come, delight of our hearts...

Come, Redeemer and Lord...

The Savior is waiting to enter your heart
Why don't you let Him come in
There's nothing in this world to keep you apart
What is your answer to Him

Time after time, He has waited before
And now He is waiting again
To see if you're willing to open the door
Oh, how He wants to come in
If you'll take one step toward the Savior, my friend
You'll find His arms open wide
Receive Him and all of your darkness will end
With in your heart He'll abide
