I will sing for ever of your love,<br>
My mouth will proclaim your truth,<br>
For your love is established forever,<br>
Your faithfulness is firm as the heavens.<br>

I have made a covenant with my chosen,<br>
I have sworn to David my servant,<br>
I will establish your dynasty forever,<br>
And set up your throne through all ages.<br>

The heavens proclaim your wonders,<br>
The assembly of your holy ones. your truth.<br>
Who in the skies can compare with the Lord?<br>
Who is like the Lord among the sons of God?<br>

Happy the people who acclaim such a king,<br>
Who walk in the light of your face,<br>
Who find their joy in your face,<br>
Who make your justice the source of their bliss.<br>

Of old you spoke in a vision,<br>
To your friends the prophets you said:<br>
"I have set the crown on a warrior,<br>
I have exalted one chosen from the people.<br>

I have selected David, my servant,<br>
And on him my holy oil has been poured,<br>
My hand shall always be with him<br>
And my arm shall make him strong.<br>

He will say to me: "You are my father.<br>
My God, the rock who saves me".<br>
And I will make him my ÃŸrstborn,<br>
And the highest of the kings of the earth.<br>

I will keep my love for him always,<br>
For him my covenant shall endure,<br>
I will establish his dynasty forever,<br>
Make his throne as lasting as the heavens.<br>

His dynasty shall last forever.<br>
In my sight his throne is like the sun,<br>
Like the moon it shall endure forever.<br>
A faithful witness in the skies.<br>

Ref.:<br>
Be born in us, Incarnate Love! (2)<br>

Take our flesh and blood and give us your humanity.<br>

Take our eyes and give us your vision;<br>

Take our hands and fold them in your prayer.<br>

Take our hearts and give them your will to love.<br>

Ant.:<br>
Rejoice, rejoice, for Christ has come<br>
and all have seen his salvation.<br>

O sing to God new songs of praise<br>
For all the wonders he's worked for us.<br>
His hand has won him victory,<br>
His arm has brought us salvation.<br>

The Lord has shown his saving power,<br>
Revealed his justice to all mankind,<br>
Remembering his truth and love,<br>
His mercy for his own people.<br>

The furthest corners of the earth<br>
Have seen how mightily God can save.<br>
Let all the earth acclaim the Lord,<br>
Let all be mirth and rejoicing.<br>

Sing joyful praises to the Lord,<br>
With harp and zither make melody,<br>
With trumpets and the sound of horns,<br>
To God, the King of creation.<br>

Let ocean thunder with its waves,<br>
"Ihe world and all that within it dwell.<br>
Let all the rivers shout for joy,<br>
The hills. the mountains together.<br>

Exult, the Lord is drawing near,<br>
He comes to reign over all the earth,<br>
The world with justice he will rule<br>
And all the people with fairness.<br>
<br>
F.12<br>
Somewhere far from town and people<br>
In a stable poor,<br>
Jesus Christ was born of Mary,<br>
In a cave obscure.<br>

To seek him, don't trouble<br>
To Bethlehem to go.<br>
In silence you'll find him<br>
And in the poor next door.<br>

In the midst of noise and tumult,<br>
Can his voice be heard?<br>
No, we'll live in peace and silence,<br>
Eager for his Word.<br>

In the hungry, sick and homeless,<br>
Christ himself conceals;<br>
To the lowly, meek and humble,<br>
He himself reveals.<br>

Did you hear the angels' tiding?<br>
You can hear it still,<br>
If you bend his cave to enter,<br>
If you're of good will.<br>
<br>
F.15<br>
The light of Christ has come into the world (2).<br>

All of us must be born again<br>
To see the Kingdom of God;<br>
"Ihe water and the Spirit bring<br>
New life in God's love.<br>

God gave up his only Son<br>
Out of love for the world,<br>
So that all those who believe in Him<br>
Will live for ever.<br>

The light of God has come to us<br>
So that we might have salvation;<br>
From the darkness of our sins we walk<br>
Into glory with Christ Jesus.<br>
<br>
F.16<br>
For unto us a child is born,<br>
Unto us a Son is given,<br>
And the government shall be upon his shoulder<br>
And his name shall be called:<br>
Wonderful Counsellor. the Mighty God,<br>
The Everlasting Father<br>
And the Prince of Peace is He.<br>
<br>
F.40<br>
A light has shone upon us this day;<br>
For the Lord, our Saviour, is born for us.<br>

And we shall call him: Wonder Counsellor, Mighty God,<br>
Eternal Father, Prince of peace.<br>

And his dominion far and wide shall spread, bringing peace.<br>
So tender God's love for mankind.<br>

With perfect justice, he will rule the world, and with peace.<br>
The peoples with his truth, He will judge.<br>

Let all the heavens, sing a song to God, bless his name.<br>
Let all the lands and seas shout for joy.<br>

To God be glory in the highest heav'n, evermore<br>
And peace on earth to people of good will.<br>
<br>
F.41<br>
He came unto His own and His own received Him not,<br>
But His life is the light of all (2).<br>

In Him is life, in Him is life<br>
And His life is the light of all (2).<br>

But as many as received, to them He gave the power<br>
To become the children of God (2).<br>
<br>

For a great light has shone down upon the earth.<br>

F.46<br>
Christmas is a baby in a smelly stan,<br>
Jesus Christ is homeless, God who loves us all.<br>

Christmas is a mother with a fiery care<br>
For the spread of justice every one can share.<br>

Christmas is a father sharing in the birth<br>
Of a new-born infant, Child of sky and earth.<br>

Christmas is tough shepherds,<br>
wonder in their eyes,<br>
Finding God Almighty in a baby's cries.<br>

Christmas is wise scholars turning<br>
from their scrolls<br>
To the greatest mystery: God which flesh enfolds.<br>
<br>
F.48<br>
Glory to God, peace to his people on earth.<br>
We bring you tidings of joy<br>
To share to all the world around:<br>
For you a Saviour is born.<br>
A baby swathed in rags.<br>
Lying in a manger of straw: Emmanuel.<br>

Christmas comes just once a year<br>
But in your heart you know for sure,<br>
Christmas isn't Christmas<br>
If it does not last for ever, alleluia (2)<br>
Fill every moment with his goodness,<br>
Alleluia, every day, for every day is Christmas!<br>

Gratitude is the reason why we are here.<br>
We want to sing it aloud<br>
To make the world a lot more grateful<br>
For the happiness we have come<br>
To cherish and share<br>
Since Jesus came to our world on Christmas day.
