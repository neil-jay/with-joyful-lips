This is the day which the Lord has made
Let us be glad and rejoice;
He is the maker of heaven and earth
Praise him with heart and with voice
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, alleluia

This is the day which the Lord has made
Sing of his bounty and love
Thank him this day for his wonderful gifts
Poured out on us from above

This is the day which the Lord has made
Cry out in praise of his name;
We have assembled to ponder his word
May we his message proclaim

This is the day which the Lord has made
Rising, he conquered all strife
having attended his banquet of love
Rise in his newness of life

C4.
There are numerous strings in your lute
let me add my own among them

Then when you smite your chords
My heart will break its silence
And my heart will be one with your song

Amidst your numberless stars
Let me place my own little lamp

In the dance of your festival of lights
My heart will throb and 
My life will be one with your smile	

CC.6
Great indeed are your works, O Lord
Now and evermore
Great indeed are your works, O Lord
Now and evermore

The universe, night and day
tells of all your wonders
You are our life and our light
We shall praise you always

You are the path which we tread
You will lead us onward
From every corner of earth
All the nations gather

You lead us all by the hand
to the heavenly kingdom
Then at the end of all time
You will come in glory

C.17
O give thanks to the Lord, for he is good (3)
Yes eternal is his love

I will sing to my God never ceasing
all my life I will tell all his wonders
He’s the maker of all earth and heaven
of the ocean the seas and all they hold

The Almighty is faithful for ever
He is just to the poor and the outraged
It is He who gives bread to the hungry
Who delivers the captives from their chains

He gives sight to the blind in his mercy
and he raises the lowly the humble
It is he who gives shelter to strangers
Every orphan and widow he defends

To the just he is gracious and loving
But the wicked he foils and they stumble
Yes, the Lord reigns for ever and ever
He is king over Sion without end

To the Spirit for ever glory be, Al

C.24
All things bright and beautiful
All creatures great and small
All things wise and wonderful
The good God made them all

Each little that opens
Each little that sings
He made their glowing colours
He made their tiny wings

The purple headed mountains
The river running by
The sunset and the morning
That brightens up the sky

The cold wind in the winter
The pleasant summer sun
The ripe fruits in the country
He made them every one

He gave us eyes to see them
And lips that we might tell
How great is God almighty
Who has made all things well

Dawn it is breaking
Dawn it is breaking, the night, it has gone
Day is beginning, the air’s filled with song
All around there is music and beauty and peace
Thank you, O Lord, for sharing these things with me

Walking thro’ fields hear the sound of the wind
Carried along by the song that it sings

Sit by a stream on a warm afternoon
Flowing along with its own special tune

Stand on a beach, see the sea meet the sky
Waves breaking gently while white seagulls cry

Sun, it is setting, the night, it is nigh
Day, it is ending the moon’s in the sky

C.59
Heav’n and earth proclaim God’s glory;
Skies and seas show forth his handiworks
Day and night take up the story:

Hills and mountains, bless the Lord!
You sun, you moon, O bless, bless the Lord
Stars of heaven, bless the Lord
		
Waters and seas… Plants and earth, now….
Wild beast and tame…. All you creatures…

Humble of hearts…. All you just, now….
Fountains and springs…. Night and day, now….

Sing now to God…. God, our Father….
For Christ his Son… Spirit Holy….

It tells the power of your love

From the seas to the heavens above

The morning whispers of purity
The evening of your peace
The thunder booms your exuberance
In the awesome power you release

The tenderness of a new-born child
The gentleness of the rain
Simplicity in a single cell
And complexity in a brain

Your stillness rests in a silent pool
Infinity drifts in space
Your grandeur straddles the mountain tops
And we see your face in each face

In His time, In His time
He makes all things beautiful in His time
Lord, please show me every day
As you’re teaching me Your way
That you do just what You say in Your time

In Your time, In Your time
You make all things beautiful in Your time
Lord, my life to You I bring
With its winter and its spring
May I fathom everything in Your time

There’s a time, there’s a time
Both for sowing and for reaping there’s a time
Time for losing time for gain
Time for joy and time for pain
Every purpose under heaven has a time

There are times, there are days
Weeks and months we cannot understand God’s ways
If for years we fail to scan
What is his eternal plan
We’ll remember that He can, all the time

And I will glorify your name for evermore
With all my heart

For great is your mercy towards me
And you have delivered my soul from eternal death
There is none like you, O Lord, upon the earth
In heav’n above

For true to your promise you are
And patient with all the humble hearts
Who trust in you, There is none…

For full of compassion you are
So gracious, so ready to forgive the sinful soul
There is none…
