I.7		
The spotless Robe of Christ
The spotless robe of Christ was mine
The day I was baptised
The spotless robe of Christ was mine
The day I was baptised
And at his feast I took the place
Of those who his call had despised
The spotless robe of Christ was mine
The day I was baptised

His loving  hand was placed on me
And he did call me friend
And claiming me as his own child
Did royal favours extend

The light of Christ now shines through me
His Paschal joy on my brow
With lamp alight the bridegroom shall find
Me always awaiting Him now

What joy to be in Paradise
And share God’s heavenly bliss
And we ourselves shall godlike be
Our faces resplendent like his

I.24
Good news, good news.. Go proclaim to all the G.N., G.N.
Go and tell the world “With Jesus we have
Risen, alleluia, death shall reign no more”

We have broken bread in his memory
We have drunk his wine
We have shared the meal of sincerity
Now we walk in love

We impart a secret which God decreed
Ere the world began
That grain of wheat should fall and die
If it must bear fruit

Listen to the folly of what we preach
Take heed and believe
All we know is nothing but Jesus
And him crucified

I.27
Proclamation:
He is Lord He is Lord
He is risen from the dead and He is Lord
Every knee shall bow, every tongue confess
That Jesus Christ is Lord
