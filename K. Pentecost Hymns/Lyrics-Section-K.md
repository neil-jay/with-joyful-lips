# K.5<span> SPLENDOUR OF CREATION / Psalm 103<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Send forth your Spirit, O Lord,**<br>
**That the face of the earth be renewed.**<br>

O my soul, arise and bless the Lord God,<br>
O Lord, in majesty,<br>
Enrobed with pow'r and eternal might.<br>

You are clothed with splendour and with beauty;<br>
O God, and heav'nly light<br>
Is like a cloud that conceals your face.<br>

You have built your palace on the waters;<br>
On wings of winds and fire,<br>
You reign in heav'n, rule supreme on earth.<br>

Like the winds, your angels fly before you;<br>
As fire and flaming light,<br>
Your ministers stand before your throne.<br>

For the earth you fixed on its foundations;<br>
Indeed, it shall stand firm,<br>
And not be moved for unending years.<br>

While I live, I sing the praise of Yahweh,<br>
O Lord, your glorious praise<br>
My lips proclaim: Blessed be the Lord.<br>

Praise to God, the author of these marvels,<br>
To God, the mighty One,<br>
Who made the earth, glory to his name.<br>

Branches bearing fruit in the grace of the Lord;<br>
Branches rooted in his great love,<br>
The Church of Christ the Lord!<br>

# (K)K.8<span> FROM THE CITIES<br>

From the cities, through the lanes,<br>
(Onward we must go)<br>
From the mountains, valleys, plains.<br>
From the workshops, from our tools,<br>
From the office, from our schools.<br>
### ***Chorus-1:***<br>
Onward to heaven, land for which we yearn!<br>
Praise to you, O holy City, Church of Christ,<br>
Tomorrow's home, where we hope one day<br>
To gather all united round the throne.<br>
### ***Chorus-2:***<br>
Filled with hope, forth we go,<br>
To the city of our God.<br>
Onward then, Church of Christ,<br>
Be united round his throne.<br>

Whether joyful or distressed,<br>
With high spirits or depressed,<br>
Though we falter or succeed,<br>
Whether wealthy or in need.<br>

Glad to suffer every cross,<br>
Counting all else as a loss,<br>
Proud of being Sons of God<br>
And disciples of the Lord.<br>

With companions, kinsmen dear,<br>
To our haven drawing near,<br>
Whether healthy, whether ill,<br>
Always doing God's own will.<br>
<br>

**Send forth your Spirit, O Lord,**<br>
**That the face of the earth be renewed.**<br>

O my soul, arise and bless the Lord God,<br>
Say to Him: "My God, how great you are!"<br>

And light is the garment you wear.<br>

You have built your palace on the waters,<br>
Like the winds the angels fly before you,<br>
You have set the earth on its foundations,<br>
So firm to be shaken no more.<br>

All your creatures look to you for comfort,<br>
From your open hand they have their fill;<br>
You send forth your Spirit and revive them,<br>
The face of the earth you renew.<br>

While I live, I sing the praise of Yahweh.<br>
I will thank the author of those marvels.<br>
Praise to God the Father, Son and Spirit,<br>
Both now and for ever. Amen.<br>

All over the world, there’s a mighty revelation<br>
Of the glory of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.<br>

All over the Church, as the prophets said it would be,<br>
All over the Church, there’s a mighty revelation<br>
Of the glory of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.<br>

All over us all, the Spirit is moving,<br>
All over us all, as the prophets said it would be,<br>
All over us all, there’s a mighty revelation<br>
Of the glory of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.<br>

# K.19<span> THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**The Spirit of the Lord will be poured upon us,**<br>
**Then shall the desert soon become such fertile land.**<br>
**Justice shall take root in the thriving waste land,**<br>
**And integrity will flourish in the valleys.**<br>

The Spirit of God moves up to bring<br>
Good News to poor and stranger<br>
And to the blind: new vision clear,<br>
To set prisoners free.<br>

Called to be gift and to proclaim<br>
God's goodness for all persons,<br>
We hope to heal hearts filled with pain.<br>
And to comfort those grieving.<br>

Yes, as the earth nurtures its crop<br>
For all to share and care for,<br>
So will our God bring to birth<br>
The Spirit within us.<br>
<br>
# K.22<span> THE CHURCH'S ONE FOUNDATION<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**The Church's one foundation**<br>
**Is Jesus Christ, her Saviour and Lord.**<br>
**She is his new creation**<br>
**To bring all people to rebirth.**<br>

"I'm the vine," he says, "you're the branches.<br>
You who live in me and I in you,<br>
Abundant fruit you'll bear<br>
And glory to the Father you will bring."<br>

"You are Peter, the rock and foundation<br>
On which I will build my Church," he said.<br>
"You love me more than these?<br>
Then, Peter, tend my flock and feed my sheep."<br>

Many members, we, many parts indeed,<br>
And still we form one body,<br>
The body of the Lord,<br>
Perfected by the Spirit in our hearts.<br>
<br>

**And renew the face of the earth (2).**<br>

Bless the Lord, Oh my soul!<br>
Oh Lord, my God, you are great indeed.<br>
How manifold are your works, O Lord!<br>
The earth is full of your creatures.<br>

If you take away their breath, O Lord,<br>
They die and return to their dust.<br>
When you send forth your Spirit, they live.<br>
You renew the face of the earth.<br>

May the glory of the Lord endure for ever<br>
And may the Lord be glad in his work.<br>
Pleasing to Him be my theme,<br>
For I rejoice in the Lord.<br>

**There am I in their midst evermore.**<br>

As a Church we belong to Christ's Body,<br>
We're a kingdom of love and charity,<br>
We're a city, a light to the nations,<br>
Yes, the people of promise are we!<br>

As a Body we grow strong together<br>
When we focus our hearts on others' needs.<br>
When we hold up the banner for justice,<br>
When we love not by words but deeds.<br>

As a people we're rooted in Jesus.<br>
As a nation, united we stand!<br>
But it's only through grace we are worthy<br>
To inherit and enter our land.<br>
<br>

And will worship and honour my name.<br>

**Build your Church, Lord, make us strong, Lord,**<br>
**Join our hearts, Lord, through Your Son,**<br>
**Make us one, Lord, in Your body**<br>
**In the Kingdom of Your Son.**<br>

I have broken the walls that divide you,<br>
For I brought you a message of peace;<br>
By my cross I have ended your warfare.<br>
Gained access, in the Spirit, to God.<br>

We are strangers and aliens no longer,<br>
We belong to the household of God.<br>
Our foundation: apostles and prophets,<br>
And Christ Jesus: our firm corner-stone.
