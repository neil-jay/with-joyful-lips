X.3    
Lightened by the word we’ve heard
To the world we all must go
Nourished by the bread of life
To the world we go
Altogether in one love and faith
Seeking ever to be true
You will guide us on the path O Lord
Of eternal peace

With our joys and with our cares
To the world we all must go
Weighed by toil but raised by hope
To the world we go

Joined in peace and unity
To the world we all must go
Gathered in your charity
To the world we go

X.14	
Hungry, thirsty, Lord, we came
But joyous now we leave
Nourished by the bread of life
Renewed and ready to serve

Together we have shared this meal
The bread of unity
Help us Lord, to build a world
Where love and charity abide

You told us Lord to be the light
That shines for all to see
Send your Spirit in our hearts
To keep the fire of love ablaze

You called us, Lord, to be the salt
The heaven in the dough
Help your witnesses to stand
And speak the words of truth and life

X.19
Go the mass is ended, children of the Lord
Take his word to others as you’ve heard it spoken to you
Go the Mass is ended, go and tell the world
The Lord is good, the Lord is kind
And he loves every one

Go the Mass is ended, take his love to all
Gladden all who meet you
Fill their hearts with hope and courage
Go the Mass is ended fill the world with love
And give to all what you’ve received
The peace and joy of Christ

Go, the Mass is ended, strengthened in the Lord
Lighten every burden
Spread the joy Christ around you
Go the Mass is ended, take his peace to all
This day is yours to change the world
To make God known and loved

X.23	
Put on the armour of Jesus Christ
Build up your strength in the Lord
Gird yourself with his truth, carry faith as a shield
The Good news a sword in your hand

Let your lions be girt and your lamps alight
Waiting for the day when the Master comes
May he find your watching when he returns
He’ll come like a thief in the night

If we die with him, we shall live with him
If we now endure, we shall reign with him
If we are not faithful, he’ll still keep faith
For he can’t be false to himself

X.27
I’ll sing your glory, my God
I’ll sing your glory evermore(2)

I’ll sing your glory, glory, glory evermore (2)
	
I’ll spread your message, spread your message everywhere (2)

I’ll serve your people, serve your people lovingly (2)
		
X.28
Ring out your joy, give glory to God
Lift up your hearts and sing
Let all creation tell of his name
Praise Him for evermore

Blessed are you, God of our fathers
Glory and praise for evermore
Blessed your great and glorious holy name
Glory and praise for evermore
		
Blest in the temple of your glory…
Blessed are your who gaze into the depths…

Blest in the firmament of heaven…
Blessed are you who walk on wings of wind…

May saints and angels bless your holy name…
Blessing from sea and earth and heaven…

X.31
Colours of day dawn into the mind
The Sun has come up, the night is behind
Go down to the city, into street
And let’s give the message to the people we meet
So light up the fire and let the flame burn
Open the door, let Jesus return
Take seeds of his Spirit, let the fruit grow
Tell the people of Jesus, let his love show

Go through the park, on into the town
The sun still shines on, it never goes down
The light of the world is risen again
The people of darkness are needing our friend

Open your eyes, look into the sky
The darkness has come, the sun came to die
The evening draws on, the sun disappears
But Jesus is living and His Spirit is near.
