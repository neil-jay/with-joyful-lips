# R.1 <span> GIVE ETERNAL REST<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Give them, O Lord, eternal rest**<br>
**In your light and your peace.**<br>

You alone are pure and your justice is eternal,<br>
Your word gives healing and new life.<br>

In your mercy, O Lord, cleanse them<br>
from all human weakness<br>
And grant them your eternal rest.<br>

You are joy, you are peace, you are life<br>
and resurrection.<br>
We exiles turn to you for aid.<br>
<br>
# R.3<span> THIS DAY YOU SHALL BE WITH ME / PSALM 114<br>
### ***Chorus-1:***<br>
This day, you shall be with me in paradise.<br>
### ***Chorus-2:***<br>
I shall walk before the Lord in the land of the living.<br>

I love the Lord for he has heard<br>
My plaintive cry, my supplication.<br>

His ear to me he has inclined,<br>
Throughout my days I shall invoke him.<br>

The snares of death surrounded me,<br>
I found distress and grief before me.<br>

I called upon the name of God:<br>
"O Lord, deliver me from peril."<br>

The Lord is gracious, he is just;<br>
Our God is righteous, full of mercy.<br>

The Lord protects the simple hearts;<br>
For I was helpless and he saved me.<br>

Return, my soul, where lies your peace;<br>
The Lord has kept your feet from falling.<br>

For all the good he did for me,<br>
What shall I render to my Maker?<br>

How precious in the sight of God,<br>
How dear the death of all who love him!<br>

Grant them, O Lord, eternal rest,<br>
And shed your light on them for ever.<br>
<br>
# R.8 <span> INTO YOUR HANDS, O LORD<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Into your hands, O Lord, I commend my soul.**<br>

In you, O Lord, do I trust,<br>
leave me not confounded.<br>

Hear me and come to my aid,<br>
free me in your justice.<br>

You are my rock and my strength,<br>
lead me on and guide me.<br>

You are my refuge, O Lord,<br>
and a mighty stronghold.<br>
<br>
# R.9<span> ETERNAL REST<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Eternal rest, grant to them, O Lord**<br>
**And let perpetual light shine upon them (him, her).**<br>

I will never forget you, my people,<br>
I have carved you on the palm of my hand.<br>
I will never forget you, I will not leave you orphaned,<br>
I will never forget my own.<br>

Does a mother forget her baby?<br>
Or a woman the child within her womb?<br>
Yet even if these forget, yes, even if these forget,<br>
I will never forget my own!<br>

I will gather you from the nations,<br>
I will bring you back into your land.<br>
I will sprinkle clean water.<br>
I will give you new spirit,<br>
You'll be mine for evermore.<br>
<br>
# R.10 <span> MAY THE ANGELS GO WITH YOU<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**May the angels go with you,<br>
**To the home of God's glory.<br>
**May the saints bid you welcome<br>
**To the land of the living.<br>

Praise the Lord, all you nations.<br>
Praise the Lord, all you people.<br>
We have witnessed his mercy.<br>
He is faithful for ever.<br>

Praise the Father who made us,<br>
Praise the Son, who redeemed us,<br>
Praise the life-giving Spirit.<br>
Praise one God through all ages!<br>
<br>
# R.11 <span> A VOICE SPOKE<br>

A voice spoke from heaven: Write down what I say:<br>
"How favoured are those who die in the Lord."<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**The Spirit says this:"How favoured they are**<br>
**Whose work is now done, whose good deeds remain!"**<br>

A voice spoke from heaven: "How blest those who weep,<br>
For they shall find comfort and joy in the Lord!"<br>

A voice spoke from heaven: "Let death reign no more.<br>
I'll dwell with my people, and wipe every tear."<br>

If we die with Jesus, with Him we shall live.<br>
In Him all our sorrows, in Him all our joys.<br>

In Christ, our redemption, in Jesus, our grace,<br>
In Christ, our salvation, in Jesus, our peace!
