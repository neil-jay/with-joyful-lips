# T.1 <span> HOLY MOTHER OF OUR REDEEMER<br>

Holy Mother of our Redeemer,<br>
Ever open gate of heaven<br>
And star of the sea,<br>
Come to the aid of your children,<br>

You gave birth, O Wonder, to your Creator,<br>
Remaining ever Virgin.<br>
Receive the greetings of the Angel Gabriel,<br>
And have pity on us, sinners.<br>

**All the bright morning stars**<br>
**Sing together her praises**<br>
**And are joined by the glorious dawn.**<br>

Heavenly choirs of angels rejoice and give praise,<br>
As Mary the Virgin rises on high.<br>

I see her lovely as fiery dawn breaking forth,<br>
A glow like the sun resplendent above.<br>

I see her lovely, radiantly reigning above,<br>
As Queen of the Heavens, close to her Son.<br>

See her ascend, a vapour of incense and myrrh,<br>
A radiant mist, a fragrant perfume.<br>

O let all ages rise up in praise of your Son,<br>
Proclaiming his name as Jesus, the Lord.<br>

O Virgin Mary, Queen of all angels and men,<br>
O full of his grace, implore God for us.<br>

Holy Virgin Mary.<br>

You are the greatest joy of Israel,<br>
Holy Virgin Mary.<br>

You are the highest honour of our race,<br>
Holy Virgin Mary.<br>

May you be blest by the Lord most high,<br>
Holy Virgin Mary.<br>

Now and for all ages without end,<br>

**The Lord has done marvels for me,**<br>
**holy is his name.**<br>

My soul glorifies the Lord,<br>
My spirit rejoices in God, my Saviour.<br>

He looks on his servant in her nothingness.<br>
Henceforth all ages will call me blessed.<br>

The Almighty works marvels for me,<br>
Holy his name.<br>

His mercy is from age to age,<br>
On those who fear him.<br>

He puts forth his arm in strength<br>
And scatters the proud hearted.<br>

He casts the mighty from their thrones<br>
And raises the lowly.<br>

He fills the starving with good things,<br>
Sends the rich away empty.<br>

He protects Israel, his servant,<br>
Remembering his mercy.<br>

The mercy promised to our fathers,<br>
For Abraham and his sons for ever.<br>

Praise the Father, the Son and Holy Spirit,<br>
Both now and for ever, world without end.<br>
<br>
# T.8 <span>MY SOUL SINGS THE GLORY OF GOD<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**My soul sings the glory of God,**<br>
**My spirit finds joy in the Lord, my Saviour.**<br>

So tenderly he looks upon his humble maid,<br>
Henceforth will generations call me blest.<br>

The Lord, the mighty one, whose name is holy,<br>
So wonderfully has he dealt with me.<br>

To those who fear him, his mercy is sure,<br>
His mercy which endures from age to age.<br>

The deeds his arm has done,<br>
disclose his mighty power;<br>
The arrogant of heart he puts to rout.<br>

He tore imperial powers,<br>
brought kings down from their thrones,<br>
The humble he has lifted high.<br>

The starving he has filled with good things from above,<br>
And empty-handed sent away the rich.<br>

His servant Israel he helped with faithful care,<br>
Remembering his holy covenant.<br>

The mercy which of old he showed to our race,<br>
To Abraham and his posterity.<br>

To God, the mighty One, give praise for ever more,<br>
The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit blest.<br>
<br>

A helpless little babe, from Herod’s wrath he’ll run.<br>
And in a foreign land, long years he’ll have to linger."<br>
And Mary bowed and said: "God’s will be done!"<br>

"And soon the day will come when enemies will round him,<br>
And nail him to a tree, your sinless, spotless one.<br>
The price of mankind’s ransom will heavy full upon him."<br>
And Mary bowed and said: "God’s will be done!"<br>

### ***Chorus-2:***<br>
**You are all beautiful, O Virgin Mary,**<br>
**You are all beautiful!**<br>

O listen, my daughter, listen and hear my voice:<br>
The king desires your loveliness.<br>

For he is the Lord; all honour and praise are his.<br>
Forget your people and your home.<br>

In garments of wealth, adorned as a queen she stands<br>
Before the King within his courts.<br>

And following after, maidens await her wish;<br>
They come with gladness, filled with joy.<br>

Your name will be blest throughout all the days to come,<br>
And all the nations honour you.<br>

My heart overflows with joy as I sing your praise;<br>
I sing my song before the King.<br>

All honour and praise and blessings to Mary's Son,<br>
All thanks and glory evermore.<br>

O Mother of God and mother of all mankind,<br>
Guide us to Christ, your blessed Son.<br>

# T.24 <span> HAIL, HOLY QUEEN<br>
Hail Holy Queen, Mother of Mercy,<br>
Hail, our life, our sweetness and our hope.<br>
To you, do we cry, Eve’s poor banished children,<br>
Mourning and weeping in this vale of tears,<br>
Turn then, most gracious Advocate,<br>
Your eyes of mercy unto us;<br>
After our exile, show to us<br>
The fruit of your womb, Jesus.<br>
O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary! (2)<br>

O bless’d among all women, O Mary, pray for us.<br>

You magnify the Lord and praise his holy name.<br>
O bless’d among all women, O Mary, pray for us.<br>

The Lord, the mighty God, has done great things for you.<br>
O bless’d among all women, O Mary, pray for us.<br>

Your Son at your request, turned water into wine.<br>
O bless’d among all women, O Mary, pray for us.<br>

You stood beside the cross unto the very last.<br>
O bless’d among all women, O Mary, pray for us.<br>

Now show yourself to us as Mother of all mankind.<br>
O bless’d among all women, O Mary, pray for us.<br>
<br>
# T.29 <span> INVOCATION TO MARY<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Help us to live as your children,**<br>
**O give us your courage to say: Amen!**<br>

When in the darkness we stumble,<br>
When we are lacking in faith.<br>

When we are hard-pressed with suffering,<br>
Love seems so far, far away.<br>

When life to us seems a burden,<br>
When all our work is in vain.<br>

Help us to live our commitment,<br>
Help us to answer God’s call.<br>
<br>
# T.30 <span>TO OUR LADY OF THE WAY<br>

No one can live as an island,<br>
Journeying through life alone.<br>
Since we're most loved by a mother,<br>
Jesus gave us his own.<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Be with us, Mary, along the way.**<br>
**Guide every step we take.**<br>
**Lead us to Jesus, your loving Son.**<br>
**Come with us, Mary, come.**<br>

When Jesus met with rejection,<br>
Mary stood by the cross.<br>
How can a mother desert her son?<br>
She'll also stand by us.<br>

Help us, O star of the ocean,<br>
Be with us in our strife.<br>
When we are faced with temptation,<br>
Tossed by the storms of life.<br>

Often enough in life's banquet,<br>
We shall run short of wine.<br>
Then, as at Cana, request your Son<br>
To make our lives divine.<br>
<br>
# T.32 <span> I WILL GREATLY REJOICE<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**I will greatly rejoice in the Lord (2)**<br>
**My soul shall exult, shall exult in my God.**<br>
**I will greatly rejoice in the Lord.**<br>

For he has clothed me with the garment of salvation,<br>
He has covered me with the robe of righteousness,<br>
As a bridegroom decks himself with a garland,<br>
As a bride adorns herself with jewels.<br>

For as the earth brings forth its shoots<br>
And as a garden causes what is sown in it to spring up,<br>
So the Lord will cause righteousness and praise<br>
To spring forth before all the nations.<br>
<br>
# T.33 <span>O WITH WHAT JOY<br>

O with what joy we sing of Mary,<br>
A woman of great love,<br>
Whose openness and loving kindness,<br>

Be with us as we pray<br>
To know the whisper of his presence.<br>
The wonder of his love!<br>
<br>

Mary, we love you, Mary we praise you,<br>
You are the joy of the earth.<br>
Angels revere you, Saints gather near you,<br>
Heaven rejoiced at your birth.<br>

Virgin most prudent, Daughter of Sion,<br>
Bright as the morning star.<br>
Fair as the moonbeams, Clear as the sunshine,<br>
Your splendour reaches afar.<br>

Fairest of creatures, Purest of virgins,<br>
You are our pride and our boast.<br>
Bringing the Saviour, Conquering evil,<br>
Guiding the sinner when lost.<br>

Child of the Father, Mother of Jesus,<br>
Bride of the Spirit of Love.<br>
Reigning triumphant, Leading your children<br>
Home to heaven above.<br>
<br>
# T.35 <span> HOLY VIRGIN, BY GOD'S DECREE<br>
Holy Virgin, by God’s decree,<br>
You were called eternally,<br>
That He could give his Son to our race.<br>

By your faith and loving accord<br>
As the handmaid of the Lord,<br>
Your undertook God’s plan to embrace.<br>
Mary, we thank you, hail full of grace.<br>

Refuge for your children so weak,<br>
Sure protection all can seek.<br>
Problems of life you help us to face,<br>
Mary, we trust you, hail full of grace.<br>

To our needy world of today,<br>
Love and beauty you portray.<br>
Showing the path to Christ we must trace,<br>
Mary, our mother, hail full of grace.<br>
<br>
# T.37 <span> WHEN YOU CAME TO BETHLEHEM<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Ave Maria, Mother of God’s son.**<br>
**Mother of our Saviour,**
**Christ the Promised one...**<br>

When you came to Bethlehem,<br>
Shelter there was none,<br>
No one had a room to give<br>
You and God’s own Son. (2)<br>

Every Christmas it’s his wish<br>
To be born again,<br>
Not within a stable cold<br>
But our human hearts. (2)<br>

We would like our hearts prepared,<br>
Help us Mother dear.<br>
May we really welcome Him,<br>
When He’s born this year. (2)<br>
<br>
# T.38 <span>YOUR GREATNESS<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Your greatness was your faith,**<br>
**Your greatness was your love.**<br>
**Your greatness was your given word**<br>
**When you said "Yes" to the Lord.**<br>

Rejoice, highly favoured, the Lord is with you.<br>
"You shall become a mother": the Lord's<br>
own words to you.<br>

Rejoice, Abraham's daughter, obedient in faith.<br>
Like Isaac of the promise, your Son we all await.<br>

Rejoice, Zion's daughter, the mother of our King,<br>
We, his kingly people, to you we gladly sing.<br>
<br>
# T.40 <span>MOTHER OF Jesus<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Mother of Jesus and Mother of lowliness,**<br>
**Bearing the Light of the world,**<br>
**Radiant with glory, the glory of Jesus,**<br>
**Conceived by the Spirit of God.**<br>

In the beginning of time,<br>
God's Holy Spirit did shine,<br>
Breathed on the deep and the darkness of night,<br>
Bringing the promise of light.<br>

Then in the fullness of time<br>
Came the same Spirit sublime,<br>
Breathed on the womb of the Virgin of grace,<br>
Called her the chosen of God.<br>

Wondrous the moment that heard<br>
You say "Amen" to the Word;<br>
Son of the Father and Light of his Light,<br>
Face of the Godhead unveiled.<br>

Mary, our Lady of light,<br>
You are the Father's delight:<br>
Pray for us, sinners, to Jesus, your Son,<br>
Show us the Light of the world.<br>
<br>

### ***Chorus:***<br>
**O Virgin fair, star of the sea,**<br>
**My dearest mother, pray for me.**<br>

O Lady, full of God’s own grace,<br>
Whose caring hands the child embraced,<br>
Who listened to the Spirit’s word,<br>
Believed and trusted in the Lord.<br>

O Lady, who felt daily joy,<br>
In caring for the holy boy,<br>
Whose home was plain and shorn of wealth,<br>
Yet was enriched by God’s own breath.<br>

O Lady, who bore living’s pain,<br>
But still believed that love would reign,<br>
Who on a hill watched Jesus die<br>
As on the cross they raised Him high.<br>

O Lady, who on Easter day,<br>
Had all your sorrow wiped away,<br>
As God the Father’s will was done,<br>
When from death’s hold He freed your Son.<br>
<br>

**My spirit sings his praise.**<br>
**He looks on me, He lifts me up,**<br>
**And gladness fills my days.**<br>

All nations now will share my joy,<br>
His gifts He has outpoured.<br>
His little ones He has made great<br>
I magnify the Lord.<br>

His mercy is for evermore!<br>
His name I praise again!<br>
His strong right arm puts down the proud<br>
And raises lowly ones.<br>

He fills the hungry with good things,<br>
The rich He sends away.<br>
The promise made to Abraham<br>
Is filled by Him each day.<br>
<br>

Every dream and wish are yours.<br>
Mother of Christ, mother of mine,<br>
Present them to my Lord.<br>

As I kneel before you,<br>
And I see your smiling face,<br>
Every thought, every word<br>
Is lost in your embrace.<br>
