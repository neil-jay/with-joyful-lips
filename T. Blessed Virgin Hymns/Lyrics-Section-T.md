# T.4 <span> ALL THE BRIGHT MORNING STARS<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**All the bright morning stars**<br>
**Sing together her praises**<br>
**And are joined by the glorious dawn.**<br>

Heavenly choirs of angels rejoice and give praise,<br>
As Mary the Virgin rises on high.<br>

I see her lovely as fiery dawn breaking forth,<br>
A glow like the sun resplendent above.<br>

I see her lovely, radiantly reigning above,<br>
As Queen of the Heavens, close to her Son.<br>

See her ascend, a vapour of incense and myrrh,<br>
A radiant mist, a fragrant perfume.<br>

O let all ages rise up in praise of your Son,<br>
Proclaiming his name as Jesus, the Lord.<br>

O Virgin Mary, Queen of all angels and men,<br>
O full of his grace, implore God for us.<br>
<br>

**You are the honour,**<br>
**You are the glory of our people,**<br>
**Holy Virgin Mary.**<br>
<br>
You are the glory of Jerusalem,<br>
Holy Virgin Mary.<br>

You are the greatest joy of Israel,<br>
Holy Virgin Mary.<br>

You are the highest honour of our race,<br>
Holy Virgin Mary.<br>

May you be blest by the Lord most high,<br>
Holy Virgin Mary.<br>

Now and for all ages without end,<br>
Holy Virgin Mary.<br>

Give praise to God in the Church and Christ,<br>
Holy Virgin Mary.<br>
<br>
# T.20 <span> MARY SAID: "YES"<br>
"O maiden, will you be the mother of the Saviour?<br>
Your God has chosen you to give the world his Son.<br>
His power will be your shield, his Spirit come upon you."<br>
And Mary bowed and said: "God’s will be done!"<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**And Mary said: Yes, and Mary said: Yes,**<br>
**And Mary said: Yes, when she knew**<br>
**that it was the will of God.**<br>

"No cradle will be his, but just a simple manger,<br>
A helpless little babe, from Herod’s wrath he’ll run.<br>
And in a foreign land, long years he’ll have to linger."<br>
And Mary bowed and said: "God’s will be done!"<br>

"And soon the day will come when enemies will round him,<br>
And nail him to a tree, your sinless, spotless one.<br>
The price of mankind’s ransom will heavy full upon him."<br>
And Mary bowed and said: "God’s will be done!"<br>
<br>
# T.24 <span> HAIL, HOLY QUEEN<br>
Hail Holy Queen, Mother of Mercy,<br>
Hail, our life, our sweetness and our hope.<br>
To you, do we cry, Eve’s poor banished children,<br>
Mourning and weeping in this vale of tears,<br>
Turn then, most gracious Advocate,<br>
Your eyes of mercy unto us;<br>
After our exile, show to us<br>
The fruit of your womb, Jesus.<br>
O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary! (2)<br>

**O pray for us, poor sinners, Hail, Mary, full of grace.**<br>

You heard the word of God and kept it in your heart,<br>
O bless’d among all women, O Mary, pray for us.<br>

You magnify the Lord and praise his holy name.<br>
O bless’d among all women, O Mary, pray for us.<br>

The Lord, the mighty God, has done great things for you.<br>
O bless’d among all women, O Mary, pray for us.<br>

Your Son at your request, turned water into wine.<br>
O bless’d among all women, O Mary, pray for us.<br>

You stood beside the cross unto the very last.<br>
O bless’d among all women, O Mary, pray for us.<br>

Now show yourself to us as Mother of all mankind.<br>
O bless’d among all women, O Mary, pray for us.<br>
<br>
# T.29 <span> INVOCATION TO MARY<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Help us to live as your children,**<br>
**O give us your courage to say: Amen!**<br>

When in the darkness we stumble,<br>
When we are lacking in faith.<br>

When we are hard-pressed with suffering,<br>
Love seems so far, far away.<br>

When life to us seems a burden,<br>
When all our work is in vain.<br>

Help us to live our commitment,<br>
Help us to answer God’s call.<br>
<br>
# T.32 <span> I WILL GREATLY REJOICE<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**I will greatly rejoice in the Lord (2)**<br>
**My soul shall exult, shall exult in my God.**<br>
**I will greatly rejoice in the Lord.**<br>

For he has clothed me with the garment of salvation,<br>
He has covered me with the robe of righteousness,<br>
As a bridegroom decks himself with a garland,<br>
As a bride adorns herself with jewels.<br>

For as the earth brings forth its shoots<br>
And as a garden causes what is sown in it to spring up,<br>
So the Lord will cause righteousness and praise<br>
To spring forth before all the nations.<br>
<br>
# T.34 <span> LET'S SING TO OUR MOTHER<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Let’s sing to our Mother,**<br>
**As we would sing to our love,**<br>
**Mother in heaven, yet Mother with us on earth.**<br>

Mary, we love you, Mary we praise you,<br>
You are the joy of the earth.<br>
Angels revere you, Saints gather near you,<br>
Heaven rejoiced at your birth.<br>

Virgin most prudent, Daughter of Sion,<br>
Bright as the morning star.<br>
Fair as the moonbeams, Clear as the sunshine,<br>
Your splendour reaches afar.<br>

Fairest of creatures, Purest of virgins,<br>
You are our pride and our boast.<br>
Bringing the Saviour, Conquering evil,<br>
Guiding the sinner when lost.<br>

Child of the Father, Mother of Jesus,<br>
Bride of the Spirit of Love.<br>
Reigning triumphant, Leading your children<br>
Home to heaven above.<br>
<br>
# T.35 <span> HOLY VIRGIN, BY GOD'S DECREE<br>
Holy Virgin, by God’s decree,<br>
You were called eternally,<br>

Mary, we praise you, hail full of grace.<br>

### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Ave, ave, ave Maria.**<br>

By your faith and loving accord<br>
As the handmaid of the Lord,<br>
Your undertook God’s plan to embrace.<br>
Mary, we thank you, hail full of grace.<br>

Refuge for your children so weak,<br>
Sure protection all can seek.<br>
Problems of life you help us to face,<br>
Mary, we trust you, hail full of grace.<br>

To our needy world of today,<br>
Love and beauty you portray.<br>
Showing the path to Christ we must trace,<br>
Mary, our mother, hail full of grace.<br>
<br>
# T.37 <span> WHEN YOU CAME TO BETHLEHEM<br>
**Ave Maria, Mother of God’s son.**<br>
**Mother of our Saviour,**
**Christ the Promised one...**<br>

When you came to Bethlehem,<br>
Shelter there was none,<br>
No one had a room to give<br>
You and God’s own Son. (2)<br>

Every Christmas it’s his wish<br>
To be born again,<br>
Not within a stable cold<br>
But our human hearts. (2)<br>

We would like our hearts prepared,<br>
Help us Mother dear.<br>
May we really welcome Him,<br>
When He’s born this year. (2)<br>
<br>
# T.44 <span> O VIRGIN FAIR<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**O Virgin fair, star of the sea,**<br>
**My dearest mother, pray for me.**<br>

O Lady, full of God’s own grace,<br>
Whose caring hands the child embraced,<br>
Who listened to the Spirit’s word,<br>
Believed and trusted in the Lord.<br>

O Lady, who felt daily joy,<br>
In caring for the holy boy,<br>
Whose home was plain and shorn of wealth,<br>
Yet was enriched by God’s own breath.<br>

O Lady, who bore living’s pain,<br>
But still believed that love would reign,<br>
Who on a hill watched Jesus die<br>
As on the cross they raised Him high.<br>

O Lady, who on Easter day,<br>
Had all your sorrow wiped away,<br>
As God the Father’s will was done,<br>
When from death’s hold He freed your Son.<br>
<br>
# T.45 <span> MY SOUL PROCLAIMS THE LORD<br>
**My soul proclaims the Lord, my God.**<br>
**My spirit sings his praise.**<br>
**He looks on me, He lifts me up,**<br>
**And gladness fills my days.**<br>

All nations now will share my joy,<br>
His gifts He has outpoured.<br>
His little ones He has made great<br>
I magnify the Lord.<br>

His mercy is for evermore!<br>
His name I praise again!<br>
His strong right arm puts down the proud<br>
And raises lowly ones.<br>

He fills the hungry with good things,<br>
The rich He sends away.<br>
The promise made to Abraham<br>
Is filled by Him each day.<br>
<br>
# T.46 <span> AVE MARIA<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Ave Maria, gratia plena,**<br>
**Dominus tecum, benedicta tu.**<br>

As I kneel before you,<br>
As I bow my head in prayer,<br>
Take this day, make it yours<br>
And fill me with your love.<br>

All I have I give you,<br>
Every dream and wish are yours.<br>
Mother of Christ, mother of mine,<br>
Present them to my Lord.<br>

As I kneel before you,<br>
And I see your smiling face,<br>
Every thought, every word<br>
Is lost in your embrace.<br>
<br>
# T.53 <span> I WILL MAGNIFY YOUR NAME<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**I will magnify your name, O Lord, alleluia,**<br>
**I will drink of the well of your love, alleluia!**<br>

I will worship you to the end of my days,<br>
With a heart that is full of praise.<br>

The Almighty has done marvels for me,<br>
Yes, his mercy endures from age to age.<br>

He has looked upon his humble maid,<br>
Generations all will call me blest.<br>

He has filled the poor, satisfied all their needs,<br>
And the rich empty handed send away.<br>

I will worship you to the end of my days,<br>
With a heart that is full of praise.
