S.9<br>
Let all proclaim to the glory of the Father<br>
That Jesus Lord, that Jesus is Lord<br>
Let all proclaim to the glory of the Father<br>
That Jesus Christ is Lord<br>

Go to all the people, proclaim my name to all<br>
Make disciples everywhere, baptise them in my name<br>
Teach them to observe the things I’ve taught to you along<br>
Know that I am with you always until the end of time<br>
<br>
S.12<br>
Follow me, follow me, leave your home and family<br>
Leave your fishing nets and boats upon the shore<br>
Leave the seed that you have sown<br>
Leave the crops that you have grown<br>
Leave the people you have known and follow me<br>

The foxes have their holes<br>
And the swallows have their nests<br>
But the Son of man has no place to lie down<br>
I do not offer comfort<br>
I do not offer wealth<br>
But in me will all happiness be found<br>

If you would follow me<br>
You must leave old ways behind<br>
You must take my cross and follow on my path<br>
You may be far from loved ones<br>
You may be far from home<br>
But my Father will welcome you at last<br>

Although I go away<br>
You will never be alone<br>
For the Spirit will be there to comfort you<br>
Though all of you may scatter<br>
Each follow his own path<br>
Still the spirit of love will lead you home<br>
<br>
S.13<br>
Leave your country and your people<br>
Leave your family and your friends<br>
Travel to the land I’ll show you<br>
God will bless the ones He sends<br>

Go like Abraham before you<br>
When he heard the Father’s call<br>
Walking froth in faith and trusting<br>
God is master of us all<br>

Sometimes God’s word is demanding<br>
Leave security you know<br>
Breaking ties and bonds that hold you<br>
When the voice of God says: “Go”<br>

Take the path into the desert<br>
Barren seems the rock and sand<br>
God will lead you through the desert<br>
When you follow his command<br>

Go with courage upon the mountain<br>
Climb the narrow, rocky ledge<br>
Leave behind all the things that hinder<br>
Go with only God as pledge<br>
<br>
S.16<br>
You are a chosen generation<br>
A royal priesthood, a holy nation<br>
A dedicated people<br>
That should show forth the praises of him<br>
Who has called you out of darkness (3)<br>
Into his marvellous light (2)<br>
So come and sing Halleluiah, praise to the Lord<br>
Come on and sing Halleluiah<br>
And show forth the praises of Him<br>
For he has called you out of darkness (3)<br>
Into his marvellous light (2) (For....)<br>
Into freedom (4) into his marvellous light (2)<br>	
<br>
S.19<br>
God’s Spirit is in my heart<br>

God’s Spirit is in my heart<br>
He has called me and se t me apart<br>
This is what I have to do<br>
What I have to do<br>
He sent me to give the Good News to the poor<br>
Tell prisoners that they are prisoners no more<br>
Tell blind people that they can see<br>
And set the downtrodden free<br>
And go tell every one<br>
The news that the Kingdom of God has done<br>
And go tell every one<br>
The news that God’s Kingdom has come<br>

Just as the Father sent me<br>
So I’m sending you out to be<br>
My witnesses throughout the world<br>
The whole of the world<br>

Don’t carry a load in your pack<br>
You don’t need two shirts on your back<br>
A workman can earn his own keep<br>
Can earn his own keep
