# S.8 <span> HAUL, HAUL AWAY<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Haul, haul away. Haul, haul away.**<br>
**Cast the nets wide and sink the nets deep**<br>
**and it's haul, haul away.**<br>

Oh, he sat in the boat and he spoke to the crowd.<br>
Haul, haul away.<br>
And his voice wasn't soft and his voice wasn't loud.<br>
Haul, haul away.<br>
And he spoke of the just and the pure and the free,<br>
And his voice caught the air like a net in the sea.<br>
And it's...<br>

He said: "Cast your nets wide where the water is deep...<br>
Oh, cast the nets wide and sink the nets deep"...<br>
"Though we've worked through the night<br>
and we've nothing to show,<br>
We will try once again just because you say so".<br>
And it's...<br>

Oh, the catch it was huge and the boat it was small...<br>
His friends came to help when they heard Peter call...<br>
"You must leave us," said Peter, "for we're men of sin".<br>
But he said: "Come with me and be fishers of men".<br>
And it's...<br>

**Let all proclaim to the glory of the Father**<br>
**That Jesus Christ is Lord.**<br>

Go to all the people, proclaim my name to all,<br>
Make disciples everywhere, baptise them in my name,<br>
Teach them to observe the things I’ve taught to you along,<br>
Know that I am with you always until the end of time.<br>

When in prayer you gather in two or three or more,<br>
I am there among you too, to guide you all the time,<br>
You shall be my witnesses throughout the Indian land,<br>
For my Spirit shall go with you, my strength in Him you'll find.<br>

Love is what I ask you to show to all the world.<br>
Loving every friend and foe, forgiving all the time.<br>
This shall be the sign by which all people'll know you're mine.<br>
That you love and treat each other the way that I have shown.<br>
<br>
# S.10<span> COME, FOLLOW ME<br>

I am the Light, bringing you out of darkness,<br>

I am the Bread you must feed to the hungry.<br>
The wine that must fill every heart.<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Foxes have holes, birds have their nests,**<br>
**But the Son of man has no place to rest.**<br>

**Leave your nets and come, follow me.**<br>

I am the Life that must change every life<br>
And the Way that must alter your ways.<br>
I am the Truth and my word is the cross<br>
You must take if you want to be free.<br>

I am the Sower, come, work in my vineyard,<br>
My field. Tend my vines, sow the grain.<br>
And should it fall to the ground, it can only<br>
Spring up with new life, hundredfold.<br>

I am the Shepherd come into my sheepfold<br>
To help feed my lambs, feed my sheep.<br>
Bring back the straying and bind up their wounds<br>
And rejoice when you've found what was lost.<br>
<br>
# S.11<span> BLESSED ARE THEY<br>

Theirs is the Kingdom of God.<br>

Bless us, O Lord, our God.<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>

They will inherit the earth.<br>
Bless us, O Lord, make us meek and humble...<br>

Blessed are they who will mourn in sorrow.<br>
They will be comforted.<br>
Bless us, O Lord, when we share their sorrow...<br>

Blest those who hunger and thirst for justice.<br>
They will be satisfied.<br>

# S.12 <span>FOLLOW ME<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Follow me, follow me, leave your home and family,**<br>
**Leave your fishing nets and boats upon the shore.**<br>
**Leave the seed that you have sown,**<br>
**Leave the crops that you have grown,**<br>
**Leave the people you have known and follow me.**<br>

The foxes have their holes<br>
And the swallows have their nests,<br>
But the Son of man has no place to lie down.<br>
I do not offer comfort,<br>
I do not offer wealth,<br>
But in me will all happiness be found.<br>

If you would follow me,<br>
You must leave old ways behind.<br>
You must take my cross and follow on my path.<br>
You may be far from loved ones,<br>
You may be far from home,<br>
But my Father will welcome you at last.<br>

Although I go away,<br>
You will never be alone,<br>
For the Spirit will be there to comfort you.<br>
Though all of you may scatter,br>
Each follow his own path,<br>
Still the spirit of love will lead you home.<br>
<br>
# S.13<span> LEAVE YOUR COUNTRY & YOUR PEOPLE<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**Leave your country and your people,**<br>
**Leave your family and your friends.**<br>
**Travel to the land I’ll show you.**<br>
**God will bless the ones He sends.**<br>

Go like Abraham before you,<br>
When he heard the Father’s call,<br>
Walking froth in faith and trusting;<br>
God is master of us all.<br>

Sometimes God’s word is demanding,<br>
Leave security you know,<br>
Breaking ties and bonds that hold you,<br>
When the voice of God says: “Go”!<br>

Take the path into the desert;<br>
Barren seems the rock and sand.<br>
God will lead you through the desert,<br>
When you follow his command.<br>

Go with courage upon the mountain,<br>
Climb the narrow, rocky ledge,<br>
Leave behind all the things that hinder,<br>
Go with only God as pledge.<br>
<br>
# S.15<span> WE ARE GOD'S PEOPLE<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**We are God's people:**<br>
**He has called us and chosen us,**<br>
**Chosen us in Christ**<br>
**To work for the coming of his kingdom.**<br>

God gives us the Spirit of Christ<br>
that Christ may be wherever we are.<br>

God gives us the Spirit of Christ<br>
that we may bring the good news to all.<br>

God gives us the Spirit of Christ<br>
that we may spread his kingdom of peace.<br>

God gives us the Spirit of Christ<br>
that we may bring his justice to all.<br>
<br>
# S.16<span> YOU ARE A CHOSEN GENERATION<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**You are a chosen generation,**<br>
**A royal priesthood, a holy nation,**<br>
**A dedicated people**<br>
**That should show forth the praises of him**<br>
**Who has called you out of darkness (3)**<br>
**Into his marvellous light (2).**<br>

So come and sing Halleluiah, praise to the Lord.<br>
Come on and sing Halleluiah<br>
And show forth the praises of Him,<br>
For he has called you out of darkness (3)<br>
Into his marvellous light (2). (For....)<br>

**Into freedom (4), into his marvellous light (2)**<br>	
<br>
# S.17<span> THE HARVEST IS GREAT<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**The harvest is great and plentiful**<br>
**But the lab'rers are very few,**<br>
**So go in my name, reach out and proclaim:**<br>
**"The kingdom is near to you".**<br>

Nothing for your journey take,<br>
No staff, no bag, no bread.<br>
But my peace you give them and<br>
The words that I have said.<br>

Sow my seed along the path,<br>
The rock, the thorns, good soil.<br>
Some may wither, some may grow<br>
And bring forth hundredfold.<br>

See the harvest white with grain:<br>
The time to reap has come.<br>
Look, the winepress is so full,<br>
The vats now overflow.<br>

Live the "secret" you impart:<br>
That death gives way to life.<br>
How the cross of Christ destroys<br>
The wisdom of the wise!<br>
<br>
# S.19<span> GOD'S SPIRIT IS IN MY HEART<br>

God’s Spirit is in my heart,<br>
He has called me and se t me apart.<br>
This is what I have to do,br>
What I have to do.<br>
### ***Chorus:***<br>
**He sent me to give the Good News to the poor,**<br>
**Tell prisoners that they are prisoners no more,**<br>
**Tell blind people that they can see,**<br>
**And set the downtrodden free,**<br>
**And go tell every one**<br>
**The news that the Kingdom of God has come.**<br>
**And go tell every one**<br>
**The news that God’s Kingdom has come.**<br>

Just as the Father sent me,<br>
So I’m sending you out to be<br>
My witnesses throughout the world,<br>
The whole of the world.<br>

Don’t carry a load in your pack,<br>
You don’t need two shirts on your back.<br>
A workman can earn his own keep,<br>
Can earn his own keep.<br>

Don't worry what you have to say,<br>
Don't worry because on that day<br>
God's Spirit will speak in your heart,<br>
Will speak in your heart.<br>
