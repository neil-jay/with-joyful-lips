Just like a child that guilty deeds oppress<br>
With mind and heart in trouble and distress,<br>
Who throws himself into his mother’s arms,<br>
Sure she’ll free him from his qualms.<br>
<br>
# A.75<span> ALLELUIA, HEAR THE WORD<br>
Hear the word<br>
Alleluia (5 x 2)<br>

Hear the word of God<br>
Keep it in your Heart<br>
Bring forth fruit patiently<br>

If anyone loves me<br>
He will keep my word<br>
And we will come to him<br>
  
Hardened not your heart<br>
Bend to his will<br>
Listen now to his voice<br>
<br>
A.76<br>
Out of our darkness O Jesus Christ<br>
We call to you before day starts<br>
Let your light shine on us today<br>
Remain with us till shadows all<br>

O rising sun resplendence of the Father<br>
O Jesus Christ we sing to you<br>
The way of life that leads us to the Kingdom<br>
With one heart we sing your praise<br>
    
O Paschal Lamb, Good Shepherd of your people…<br>
Our saving rock, the fountain of all graces…<br>
  
O Son of God, abode of highest Glory…<br>
Royal Spouse… Redeemer of the nations…<br>
<br>
A.77<br>
First make peace with your brother (sister),<br>
Then come with your gift to the Lord, (2)<br>

It is love that I wish and not<br>
an empty sacrifice;<br>
I desire the knowledge of God<br>
and not a worthless offering.<br>

Let the ones who have bread gladly share<br>
with those who hunger now:<br>
Let them clothe the person in need.<br>
in love and tender mercy.<br>

If you bring your gift to the altar<br>
and there remember<br>
Ihat your neighbour has something against you,<br>
then leave your gift at the altar and...<br>
<br>
A.78<br>
Be glad, O People of the earth<br>
Lift up your heart with song and dance<br>
For I am with you, yes, within you, for ever<br>
You are the heart of my heart<br>

I will never forget you, O my people<br>
On the day of anguish I will answer you<br>
As you join in celebration<br>
My joy will move among you<br>
    
You will find a land to be your home<br>
Where sheep and cattle may freely roam<br>
Mountains from which springs<br>
Shall flow with living water<br>
  
I will make your faith burn brightly<br>
So that others may find life’s fullness<br>
Freedom for all captives<br>
And justice for all nations<br>

No longer will the circle<br>
Of your life, its pain and goodness<br>
Be just for yourself;<br>
Your gift to share will flower<br>

As you work for other’s freedom<br>
With a seed of hope within you<br>
Hunger shall not harm you<br>
Nor thirst withdraw your courage<br>
<br>
A.79<br>
Where Two or Three are gathered in my name,<br>
There am I, there am I in the midst of them<br>

Stay with us, Lord when we gather to praise you<br>
May we sing the joy of your love<br>

Stay with us, Lord, when we meet to adore you,<br>
May your peace in us overflow<br>

Stay with us, Lord, when we listen to your holy Word<br>
May our hearts be filled with your light<br>

Stay with us, Lord, when we come to your Paschal Feast<br>
May the Bread of Life make us one<br>

Stay with us, Lord, when we walk along together<br>
Be our faithful friend, be our guide<br>
<br>
A.80<br>
For us to Live, is to believe in Jesus the Christ and in the One who sent Him<br>

Though we have never heard his voice nor seen his face<br>
We hope to let his word take root in our lives<br>

It is in spirit an din truth that we are known;<br>
Free to be lifted up in each other’s lives<br>

Simply to live for one another as bread;<br>
This is the call of Jesus stirring within<br>

It is God’s spirit that gives life and not the flesh;<br>
Yes, Jesus’ words, for us, are spirit and life<br>

Nothing can take from us the hope in which we’ve grown<br>
Not even death shall separate us from his love<br>

With inner freedom to be gift with our lives<br>
No longer shall our days be centered on self<br>

If we should thirst for truth and ask for more of life<br>
Then shall the Spirit waken faith that is real<br>
<br>
A.81<br>
What a Joy for us to say:<br>
“We’re on our way to the house of the Lord” (2)<br>

Coming to Jerusalem, on this holy ground<br>
City mounted on a hill, its houses all around<br>

All the tribes of Israel, countless caravans<br>
Everyone is going there to where the temple stands<br>

Through your gates we’ll enter in, open wide the door<br>
Here we’ll find a welcome place and a peace for evermore<br>

Here within your walls each one may be safe at last<br>
City of my happy heart, a fortress holding fast<br>

Dearest name of all my friends, may you prosper still<br>
Standing like a sentinel on Zion’s royal hill<br>
<br>
A.82<br>
We are climbing up the mountain of the Lord<br>
Who will teach us to walk in his ways.<br>

For the law shall go forth out of Sion.<br>
And the Word of the Lord from his hill.<br>

He'll transform all our spears into ploughshares.<br>
Of our swords he will make pruning hooks.<br>

No more nation shall fight other nations.<br>
Nor of war shall they learn any more.<br>

Though your sins be like scarlet or crimson.<br>
Through his love they shall be white as snow.<br>
<br>
A.83<br>
Faith in God can move the mountains,<br>
Trust in Him can calm the sea.<br>
He's my fortress, He's my stronghold,<br>
He's the rock who rescues me.<br>

Lord, you are my refuge,<br>
Never let me be ashamed.<br>
In your justice. rescue me,<br>
Turn to me and hear my prayer.<br>

You are my salvation.<br>
From oppression set me free.<br>
Ever since my childhood.<br>
You have been my only hope.<br>

Bitter troubles burden me,<br>
But you fill me with new life.<br>
From the grave you raise me up.<br>
So my tongue will sing your praise.<br>
<br>
A.85<br>
Unless you become like little children<br>
You shall not see the face of God.<br>
For the one with the heart and the eyes of a child<br>
Will see what God is like.<br>

The Lord said: Suffer little children to come unto me<br>
For such is the kingdom of heaven.<br>
So Jesus blessed the young ones<br>
and fed them with his love<br>
And asked us: Be like them (2).<br>

The Lord said: Blessed are the ones who are<br>
pure in their hearts<br>
For they are the ones who'll see God.<br>
And Jesus said of elders who lead the young to sin:<br>
They should not have been born (2).<br>

Whoever welcomes one such child in my name<br>
welcomes me,<br>
Not me but the One who sent me,<br>
And he who gives some water<br>
to one who bears my name<br>
Will lose not his reward (2).<br>

O Heavenly Father, said the Lord, do I thank<br>
you once more<br>
For hiding these things from the learned,<br>
Revealing them to children<br>
and those with simple hearts<br>
For such was what you willed (2).<br>
<br>
A.86<br>
Listen, let your heart keep seeking<br>
Listen to his constant speaking<br>
Listen to the Spirit calling you<br>
Listen to his inspiration<br>
Listen to his invitation<br>
Listen to the Spirit calling you<br>

He’s in the sound of the thunder, in the whisper of the breeze<br> 
He’s in the might of whirlwind, in the roaring of the seas<br>

He’s in the laughter of children, in the patter of the rain<br>
Hear him in cries of the suffering, in their moaning and their pain<br>

He’s in the noise of the city, in the twitter of the bird<br>
And in the night time the stillness helps you listen to his word<br>

He speaks though all your companions, thru the friendly, thru the foe<br>
Therefore give ear to the Spirit wheresoever He may blow<br>
<br>
A.88<br>
Come, Lord Jesus, come, Come to stay with me to-day;<br>
Come and be my guest to-day<br>

Lord, I am not worthy that you come to live in me<br>
You say a word and I shall be healed<br>
Yes, I shall be healed<br>

Come, Lord Jesus, come, Come to live with me today;<br>
Teach me how to live my day<br>
Guide me on the path of right<br>

Come, Lord Jesus, come, Come to pray with me to-day;<br>

You be me when I do pray<br>

Our God is waiting to save<br>
Always ready to seek the lost<br>
To answer those who pray<br>

He will protect me from their wicked hands.<br>
Beneath the shadow of his wings, I will rejoice,<br>
To find a dwelling place secure.<br>

I need not shrink before the terrors of the night,<br>
Nor stand alone before the light of day.<br>
No harm shall come to me, no arrows strike me down.<br>
No evil settle in my soul.<br>

Although a thousand ones have fallen at my side,<br>

To wage my battle with the foe.<br>

Sun and the moon, bless the Lord,<br>
Bless him, all of the earth,<br>
Sea and its waves, glory in your power,<br>
Let your thunder echo His name.<br>

Let all creation arise<br>
And give praise to our God,<br>
For Yahweh alone is God.<br>
He made us, we belong to Him.<br>

Women and men, praise our God.<br>
And children, lift up your hearts.<br>
Enter his gates with songs of joy:<br>
With gladness serve you the Lord!<br>
<br>
A.130<br>
Unto you do we lift our eyes (hands, heart) (2).<br>
O Lord, have mercy on your servants,<br>
Unto you do we lift our eyes.<br>
<br>
A.131<br>
Sing a joyful song to the Lord, alleluia!<br>
Let the heavens and earth rejoice, alleluia!<br>

The heavens proclaim his name,<br>
And earth in reply<br>
Echoes back with joyful songs of praise.<br>

Our God is a mighty God,<br>
Unequalled in power,<br>
Yet his gentle mercy covers the earth.<br>

Sing praise, O Jerusalem,<br>
Sing praise to your King!<br>
He shall rule with justice age after age.<br>
<br>
A.132<br>
Children of God, hear his holy Word!<br>
Gather round the table of the Lord!<br>
Eat his body, drink his blood<br>
And we'll sing a song of love, Alleluia (3), Alleluia.<br>

Brothers, sisters, we are one,<br>
And our life has just begun.<br>
In the Spirit we are young: we can live for ever.<br>

Shout together to the Lord<br>
Who has prornised our reward:<br>
Happiness a hundred fold and we'll live for ever.<br>

Jesus gave a new command<br>
That we love our friends and foes<br>
Till we reach the promised land where<br>
we'll live for ever.<br>

If we want to live with him,<br>
We must also die with him,<br>
Die to selfishness and sin and we'll live for ever.<br>

Make the world a unity,<br>
Make of all one family<br>
Till we meet the Trinity and live for ever.<br>
<br>

Awake and sing my soul!<br>
Awake and play my harp and zither!<br>
Let the dawning day join in praise!<br>

Yes, my heart is ready now to praise you, O Lord,<br>
To bless and thank you, God of my salvation, alleluia!<br>

Great indeed and wonderful your glory, my God,<br>
Your holy name is higher than the heavens, alleluia!<br>

Your glory lights the firmament on high, alleluia!<br>

Draw near to God and He'll draw near to you (2)<br>
He'll draw near to you.<br>

Lift up holy hands to Him and glorify his name.<br>
Open up your heart to Him and praise Him for his deeds.<br>

Humbly give yourself to Him and fight the evil one.<br>
Realise your worthlessness: the Lord will raise you up.<br>

Wash your hands and let your mind be filled with Him alone.<br>
He resists the haughty ones, gives courage to the poor.<br>

Harden not your heart today but listen to his voice.<br>
Place your trust in his commands: a lamp to guide your steps.<br>
<br>
